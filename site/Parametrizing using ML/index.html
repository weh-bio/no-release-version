        <tr id="Many real-world systems such as social networks and moving planets are dynamic in nature, where a set of coupled objects are connected via the interaction graph and exhibit complex behavior along the time. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic can be considered as a dynamical system, where objects represent geographical locations (e.g., states) whose daily confirmed cases of infection evolve over time. Outbreak at one location may influence another location as people travel between these locations, forming a graph. Thus, how to model and predict the complex dynamics for these systems becomes a critical research problem. Existing work on modeling graph-structured data mostly assumes a static setting. How to handle dynamic graphs remains to be further explored. On one hand, features of objects change over time, influenced by the linked objects in the interaction graph. On the other hand, the graph itself can also evolve, where new interactions (links) may form and existing links may drop, which may in turn be affected by the dynamic features of objects. In this paper, we propose coupled graph ODE: a novel latent ordinary differential equation (ODE) generative model that learns the coupled dynamics of nodes and edges with a graph neural network (GNN) based ODE in a continuous manner. Our model consists of two coupled ODE functions for modeling the dynamics of edges and nodes based on their latent representations respectively. It employs a novel encoder parameterized by a GNN for inferring the initial states from historical data, which serves as the starting point of the predicted latent trajectories. Experiment results on the COVID-19 dataset and the simulated social network dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.">

        <tr id="We introduce a flexible, scalable Bayesian inference framework for nonlinear dynamical systems characterised by distinct and hierarchical variability at the individual, group, and population levels. Our model class is a generalisation of nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) dynamical systems, the statistical workhorse for many experimental sciences. We cast parameter inference as stochastic optimisation of an end-to-end differentiable, block-conditional variational autoencoder. We specify the dynamics of the data-generating process as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) such that both the ODE and its solver are fully differentiable. This model class is highly flexible: the ODE right-hand sides can be a mixture of user-prescribed or “white-box” sub-components and neural network or “black-box” sub-components. Using stochastic optimisation, our amortised inference algorithm could seamlessly scale up to massive data collection pipelines (common in labs with robotic automation). Finally, our framework supports interpretability with respect to the underlying dynamics, as well as predictive generalization to unseen combinations of group components (also called “zero-shot” learning). We empirically validate our method by predicting the dynamic behaviour of bacteria that were genetically engineered to function as biosensors.">

        <tr id="The advent of machine learning has led to innovative approaches in dealing with clinical data. Among these, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), hybrid models merging mechanistic with deep learning models have shown promise in accurately modeling continuous dynamical systems. Although initial applications of Neural ODEs in the field of model-informed drug development and clinical pharmacology are becoming evident, applying these models to actual clinical trial datasets-characterized by sparse and irregularly timed measurements-poses several challenges. Traditional models often have limitations with sparse data, highlighting the urgent need to address this issue, potentially through the use of assumptions. This review examines the fundamentals of Neural ODEs, their ability to handle sparse and irregular data, and their applications in model-informed drug development.">

        <tr id="Despite the wealth of single-cell multi-omics data, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of novel genetic and chemical perturbations in the human body. It requires knowledge of molecular interactions at all biological levels, encompassing disease models and humans. Current machine learning methods primarily establish statistical correlations between genotypes and phenotypes but struggle to identify physiologically significant causal factors, limiting their predictive power. Key challenges in predictive modeling include scarcity of labeled data, generalization across different domains, and disentangling causation from correlation. In light of recent advances in multi-omics data integration, we propose a new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered biology-inspired multi-scale modeling framework to tackle these issues. This framework will integrate multi-omics data across biological levels, organism hierarchies, and species to predict causal genotype-environment-phenotype relationships under various conditions. AI models inspired by biology may identify novel molecular targets, biomarkers, pharmaceutical agents, and personalized medicines for presently unmet medical needs.">

Phenotype-based drug screening emerges as a powerful approach for identifying compounds that actively interact with cells. Transcriptional and proteomic profiling of cell lines and individual cells provide insights into the cellular state alterations that occur at the molecular level in response to external perturbations, such as drugs or genetic manipulations. In this paper, we propose cycleCDR, a novel deep learning framework to predict cellular response to external perturbations. We leverage the autoencoder to map the unperturbed cellular states to a latent space, in which we postulate the effects of drug perturbations on cellular states follow a linear additive model. Next, we introduce the cycle consistency constraints to ensure that unperturbed cellular state subjected to drug perturbation in the latent space would produces the perturbed cellular state through the decoder. Conversely, removal of perturbations from the perturbed cellular states can restore the unperturbed cellular state. The cycle consistency constraints and linear modeling in the latent space enable to learn transferable representations of external perturbations, so that our model can generalize well to unseen drugs during training stage. We validate our model on four different types of datasets, including bulk transcriptional responses, bulk proteomic responses, and single-cell transcriptional responses to drug/gene perturbations. The experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating our method is highly versatile and applicable to a wide range of scenarios.

        <tr id="Predicting cancer dynamics under treatment is challenging due to high inter-patient heterogeneity, lack of predictive biomarkers, and sparse and noisy longitudinal data. Mathematical models can summarize cancer dynamics by a few interpretable parameters per patient. Machine learning methods can then be trained to predict the model parameters from baseline covariates, but do not account for uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Instead, hierarchical Bayesian modeling can model the relationship between baseline covariates to longitudinal measurements via mechanistic parameters while accounting for uncertainty in every part of the model. The mapping from baseline covariates to model parameters can be modeled in several ways. A linear mapping simplifies inference but fails to capture nonlinear covariate effects and scale poorly for interaction modeling when the number of covariates is large. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks can potentially discover interactions between covariates automatically, but at a substantial cost in computational complexity. In this work, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model of subpopulation dynamics that uses baseline covariate information to predict cancer dynamics under treatment, inspired by cancer dynamics in multiple myeloma (MM), where serum M protein is a well-known proxy of tumor burden. As a working example, we apply the model to a simulated dataset and compare its ability to predict M protein trajectories to a model with linear covariate effects. Our results show that the Bayesian neural network covariate effect model predicts cancer dynamics more accurately than a linear covariate effect model when covariate interactions are present. The framework can also be applied to other types of cancer or other time series prediction problems that can be described with a parametric model.">

        <tr id="SUMMARY
Drug response is conventionally measured at the cell level, often quantified by metrics like IC50. However, to gain a deeper understanding of drug response, cellular outcomes need to be understood in terms of pathway perturbation. This perspective leads us to recognize a challenge posed by the gap between two widely used large-scale databases, LINCS L1000 and GDSC, measuring drug response at different levels-L1000 captures information at the gene expression level, while GDSC operates at the cell line level. Our study aims to bridge this gap by integrating the two databases through transfer learning, focusing on condition-specific perturbations in gene interactions from L1000 to interpret drug response integrating both gene and cell levels in GDSC. This transfer learning strategy involves pretraining on the transcriptomic-level L1000 dataset, with parameter-frozen fine-tuning to cell line-level drug response. Our novel condition-specific gene-gene attention (CSG2A) mechanism dynamically learns gene interactions specific to input conditions, guided by both data and biological network priors. The CSG2A network, equipped with transfer learning strategy, achieves state-of-the-art performance in cell line-level drug response prediction. In two case studies, well-known mechanisms of drugs are well represented in both the learned gene-gene attention and the predicted transcriptomic profiles. This alignment supports the modeling power in terms of interpretability and biological relevance. Furthermore, our model's unique capacity to capture drug response in terms of both pathway perturbation and cell viability extends predictions to the patient level using TCGA data, demonstrating its expressive power obtained from both gene and cell levels.

These validated models are essential for predictive analytics and strategic decision-making in drug development and clinical practice. Unlike traditional methods, machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative to conventional, first-principle approaches. This paper presents an automatic method to derive unknown or uncertain (sub)models using longitudinal, heterogeneous data. Initially, we employ deep nonlinear mixed effect (DeepNLME) to train a neural network as a universal approximator, which then generates a parameterized representation of the underlying process. Subsequently, we apply symbolic regression to identify a set of potential models expressed as equations.

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

Adaptive cancer therapy is in principle the most viable approach to manage cancer’s adaptive dynamics through drug combinations with dose timing and modulation. However, there are numerous open issues facing the clinical success of adaptive therapy. Chief among these issues is the feasibility of real-time predictions of treatment response which represent a bedrock requirement of adaptive therapy. Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to learn prediction models of treatment response from clinical, molecular, and radiomics data about patients and their treatments. The article explores this potential through a proposed integration model of Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs) in a closed loop with adaptive treatments to predict the trajectories of disease progression. The conceptual model and the challenges facing its realization are discussed in the broader context of artificial intelligence integration in oncology.">

        <tr id="Combination therapy is an important direction of continuous exploration in the field of medicine, with the core goals of improving treatment efficacy, reducing adverse reactions, and optimizing clinical outcomes. Machine learning technology holds great promise in improving the prediction of drug synergy combinations. However, most studies focus on single disease-oriented collaborative predictive models or involve excessive feature categories, making it challenging to predict the majority of new drugs. To address these challenges, the DrugSK comprehensive model was developed, which utilizes SMILES-BERT to extract structural information from 3492 drugs and trains on reactions from 48,756 drug combinations. DrugSK is an integrated learning model capable of predicting interactions among various drug categories. First, the primary learner is trained from the initial data set. Random forest, support vector machine, and XGboost model are selected as primary learners and logistic regression as secondary learners. A new data set is then "generated" to train level 2 learners, which can be thought of as a prediction for each model. Finally, the results are filtered using logistic regression. Furthermore, the combination of the new antibacterial drug Drafloxacin with other antibacterial agents was tested. The synergistic effect of Drafloxacin and Isavuconazonium in the fight against Candida albicans has been confirmed, providing enlightenment for the clinical treatment of skin infection. DrugSK's prediction is accurate in practical application and can also predict the probability of the outcome. In addition, the tendency of Drafloxacin and antifungal drugs to be synergistic was found. The development of DrugSK will provide a new blueprint for predicting drug combination synergies.">

However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.

 The growing time-series data make it possible to glimpse the hidden dynamics in various fields. However, developing a computational toolbox with high interpretability to unveil the interaction dynamics from data remains a crucial challenge. Here, we propose a new computational approach called Automated Dynamical Model Inference based on Expression Trees (ADMIET), in which the machine learning algorithm, the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and the interpretability from prior knowledge are embedded into the symbolic learning scheme to establish a general framework for revealing the hidden dynamics in time-series data. ADMIET takes full advantage of both machine learning algorithm and expression tree. Firstly, we translate the prior knowledge into constraints on the structure of expression tree, reducing the search space and enhancing the interpretability. Secondly, we utilize the proposed adaptive penalty function to ensure the convergence of gradient descent algorithm and the selection of the symbols. Compared to gene expression programming, ADMIET exhibits its remarkable capability in function fitting with higher accuracy and broader applicability. Moreover, ADMIET can better fit parameters in nonlinear forms compared to regression methods. Furthermore, we apply ADMIET to two typical biological systems and one real data with different prior knowledge to infer the dynamical equations. The results indicate that ADMIET can not only discover the interaction relationships but also provide accurate estimates of the parameters in the equations. These results demonstrate ADMIET's superiority in revealing interpretable dynamics from time-series biological data.">

        <tr id="Abstract Recent advances in microfluidics and sequencing technologies allow researchers to explore cellular heterogeneity at single-cell resolution. In recent years, deep learning frameworks, such as generative models, have brought great changes to the analysis of transcriptomic data. Nevertheless, relying on the potential space of these generative models alone is insufficient to generate biological explanations. In addition, most of the previous work based on generative models is limited to shallow neural networks with one to three layers of latent variables, which may limit the capabilities of the models. Here, we propose a deep interpretable generative model called d-scIGM for single-cell data analysis. d-scIGM combines sawtooth connectivity techniques and residual networks, thereby constructing a deep generative framework. In addition, d-scIGM incorporates hierarchical prior knowledge of biological domains to enhance the interpretability of the model. We show that d-scIGM achieves excellent performance in a variety of fundamental tasks, including clustering, visualization, and pseudo-temporal inference. Through topic pathway studies, we found that d-scIGM-learned topics are better enriched for biologically meaningful pathways compared to the baseline models. Furthermore, the analysis of drug response data shows that d-scIGM can capture drug response patterns in large-scale experiments, which provides a promising way to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. Lastly, in the melanoma dataset, d-scIGM accurately identified different cell types and revealed multiple melanin-related driver genes and key pathways, which are critical for understanding disease mechanisms and drug development.">

In this work, we present a framework for constructing mechanistic models of metabolism that integrate growth-signaling control of enzyme activity and transcript dynamics. The proposed approach is applied to build models for three Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines using fed-batch culture data and time-series transcript profiles. Leveraging information from the transcriptome data, we develop a parameter estimation approach based on multi-cell-line (MCL) learning, which combines data sets from different cell lines and trains the individual cell-line models jointly to improve model accuracy. The computational results demonstrate the important role of growth signaling and transcript variability in metabolic models as well as the virtue of the MCL approach for constructing cell-line models with a limited amount of data. The resulting models exhibit a high level of accuracy in predicting distinct metabolic behaviors in the different cell lines; these models can potentially be used to accelerate the process and cell-line development for the biomanufacturing of new protein therapeutics.">

        <tr id="Hybrid dynamical systems are prevalent in science and engineering to express complex systems with continuous and discrete states. To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

The disease showcases a diverse range of onset patterns and progression trajectories, emphasizing the critical importance of early detection of functional decline to enable tailored care strategies and timely therapeutic interventions. The present investigation, spearheaded by the iDPP@CLEF 2024 challenge, focuses on utilizing sensor-derived data obtained through an app. This data is used to construct various machine learning models specifically designed to forecast the advancement of the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score, leveraging the dataset provided by the organizers. In our analysis, multiple predictive models were evaluated to determine their efficacy in handling ALS sensor data. The temporal aspect of the sensor data was compressed and amalgamated using statistical methods, thereby augmenting the interpretability and applicability of the gathered information for predictive modeling objectives. The models that demonstrated optimal performance were a naive baseline and ElasticNet regression. The naive model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.20 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.49, slightly outperforming the ElasticNet model, which recorded an MAE of 0.22 and an RMSE of 0.50. Our comparative analysis suggests that while the naive approach yielded marginally better predictive accuracy, the ElasticNet model provides a robust framework for understanding feature contributions.">

 Introduction: Heterogeneity between patients and within tumors poses challenges to effective cancer treatment. Drug combinations can overcome heterogeneity by increasing the probability that a patient will have a response to one or more drugs. This approach is successful in numerous disease settings including multiple lymphomas, but technological advances have led to a new approach to addressing heterogeneity: precision approaches that stratify patients into subpopulations with more uniform, stronger responses to specific treatments. These strategies can be implemented together to improve patient outcomes. We have developed computational mechanistic models of cancer treatment in the context of both sources of heterogeneity which explain and predict clinical outcomes of treatment of Large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) with combination chemoimmunotherapy and CAR T-cell therapy.
 Combination therapy: Our novel population tumor kinetics (pop-TK) model simulates clinical combination therapy outcomes by implementing multidrug dose response functions in heterogeneous populations of tumor cells, within heterogeneous cohorts of patients. Informed by the outcomes of novel drugs in phase 2 trials in relapsed/refractory (r/r) patients, the pop-TK model accurately predicted of outcomes of seven first-line phase 3 trials of novel combinations. Most notably, informed by treatment of r/r LBCL with polatuzumab-vedotin (pola), the pop-TK predicted the success of modifying the standard treatment regimen (RCHOP) with pola before the clinical trial results were published. The pola combination improves overall survival (OS) and PFS in Activated B-Cell (ABC) LBCL (hazard ratio (HR): OS 0.3, PFS 0.4), but reduces OS (HR: 1.6) and does not improve PFS (HR: 1.0) in Germinal Center B-Cell (GCB) LBCL. The subtype-specific difference in PFS was also predictable based on subtype results of r/r trials (predicted HR: ABC 0.3, GCB 0.9).
 CAR T-cell therapy: We used a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pop-PK/PD) model of CAR T-cell therapy to reproduce the PFS distribution and the distribution CAR T-cell abundance for CAR T therapy in r/r LBCL patients. The impact of tumor size on patient outcomes in our model and in clinical studies led us to computationally explore the impact of treating smaller tumors with CAR T-cell therapy on treatment outcomes. We found that using detectable circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as a biomarker for administering CAR T-cell therapy immediately after RCHOP increased the proportion of simulated patients without a second disease progression event by 30% (HR: 0.43 [0.34, 0.55]).
 Conclusions: The pop-TK model supports LBCL cell-of-origin subtype as a biomarker for pola performance, and the pop-PK/PD model demonstrates that detectable ctDNA is a potential biomarker for early CAR T-cell administration. These examples of model-driven precision trial design have the potential to improve outcomes using readily available biomarkers and existing therapies.

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

By employing tailored covariate-specific loss components and a self-supervised approach, TarDis effectively generates multiple latent space representations that capture each continuous and categorical target covariate separately, along with unexplained variation. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that TarDis outperforms existing methods in data integration, covariate disentanglement, and robust out-of-distribution predictions. The model’s capacity to produce interpretable and structured latent spaces, including ordered latent representations for continuous covariates, enhances its utility in hypothesis-driven research. Consequently, TarDis offers a promising analytical platform for advancing scientific discovery, providing insights into cellular dynamics, and enabling targeted therapeutic interventions.">

We introduce a novel kinetics-machine learning (kML) model that integrates baseline markers, tumor kinetics, and four on-treatment simple blood markers (albumin, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and neutrophils). Developed for immune-checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in non-small cell lung cancer on three phase II trials (533 patients), kML was validated on the two arms of a phase III trial (ICI and chemotherapy, 377 and 354 patients). It outperformed the current state-of-the-art for individual predictions with a test set C-index of 0.790, 12-months survival accuracy of 78.7% and hazard ratio of 25.2 (95% CI: 10.4-61.3, P < 0.0001) to identify long-term survivors. Critically, kML predicted the success of the phase III trial using only 25 weeks of on-study data (predicted HR = 0.814 (0.64-0.994) vs. final study HR = 0.778 (0.65-0.931)). Modeling on-treatment blood markers combined with predictive machine learning constitutes a valuable approach to support personalized medicine and drug development.

        <tr id="In oncology drug development, tumor dynamics modeling is widely applied to predict patients' overall survival (OS) via parametric models. However, the current modeling paradigm, which assumes a disease-specific link between tumor dynamics and survival, has its limitations. This is particularly evident in drug development scenarios where the clinical trial under consideration contains patients with tumor types for which there is little to no prior institutional data. In this work, we propose the use of a pan-indication solid tumor machine learning (ML) approach whereby all three tumor metrics (tumor shrinkage rate, tumor regrowth rate and time to tumor growth) are simultaneously used to predict patients' OS in a tumor type independent manner. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in a clinical trial of cancer patients treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, pralsetinib. We compared the parametric and ML models and the results showed that the proposed ML approach is able to adequately predict patient OS across RET-altered solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer as well as other solid tumors. While the findings of this study are promising, further research is needed for evaluating the generalizability of the ML model to other solid tumor types.">

        <tr id="The mammalian genome organizes into complex three-dimensional structures, where interactions among chromatin regulatory elements play a pivotal role in mediating biological functions, highlighting the significance of genomic region interactions in biological research. Traditional biological sequencing techniques like HiC and MicroC, commonly employed to estimate these interactions, are resource-intensive and time-consuming, especially given the vast array of cell lines and tissues involved. With the advent of advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies, there has been a push towards developing ML models to predict genomic interactions. However, while these models excel in predicting interactions for cell lines similar to their training data, they often fail to generalize across distantly related cell lines or accurately predict interactions specific to certain cell lines. Identifying the potential oversight of excluding example genomic region interaction information from model inputs as a fundamental limitation, this paper introduces GRACHIP, a model rooted in graph neural network technology aiming to address this issue by incorporating detailed interaction information as a hint. Through extensive testing across various cell lines, GRACHIP not only demonstrates exceptional accuracy in predicting chromatin interaction intensity but showcases remarkable generalizability to cell lines not encountered during training. Consequently, GRACHIP emerges as a potent research tool, offering a viable alternative to conventional sequencing methods for analyzing the interactions and three-dimensional organization of mammalian genomes, thus alleviating the dependency on expensive and time-consuming biological sequencing techniques. It also offers an alternative way for researchers to investigate 3D chromatin interactions and simulate their changes in model systems to test their hypotheses.">

        <tr id="Background/Aim: Despite the advances in oncology and cancer treatment over the past decades, cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases. This study focuses on further understanding the complex nature of cancer by using mathematical tumor modeling to understand, capture as best as possible, and describe its complex dynamics under chemotherapy treatment. Materials and Methods: Focusing on autoregressive with exogenous inputs, i.e., ARX, and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, i.e., ANFIS, models, this work investigates tumor growth dynamics under both single and combination anticancer agent chemotherapy treatments using chemotherapy treatment data on xenografted mice. Results: Four ARX and ANFIS models for tumor growth inhibition were developed, estimated, and evaluated, demonstrating a strong correlation with tumor weight data, with ANFIS models showing superior performance in handling the multi-agent tumor growth complexities. These findings suggest potential clinical applications of the ANFIS models through further testing. Both types of models were also tested for their prediction capabilities across different chemotherapy schedules, with accurate forecasting of tumor growth up to five days in advance. The use of adaptive prediction and sliding (moving) data window techniques allowed for continuous model updating, ensuring more robust predictive capabilities. However, long-term forecasting remains a challenge, with accuracy declining over longer prediction horizons. Conclusion: While ANFIS models showed greater reliability in predictions, the simplicity and rapid deployment of ARX models offer advantages in situations requiring immediate approximations. Future research with larger, more diverse datasets and by exploring varying model complexities is recommended to improve the models’ reliability and applicability in clinical decision-making, thereby aiding the development of personalized chemotherapy regimens.">

        <tr id="Dose-response prediction in cancer is an active application field in machine learning. Using large libraries of \textit{in-vitro} drug sensitivity screens, the goal is to develop accurate predictive models that can be used to guide experimental design or inform treatment decisions. Building on previous work that makes use of permutation invariant multi-output Gaussian Processes in the context of dose-response prediction for drug combinations, we develop a variational approximation to these models. The variational approximation enables a more scalable model that provides uncertainty quantification and naturally handles missing data. Furthermore, we propose using a deep generative model to encode the chemical space in a continuous manner, enabling prediction for new drugs and new combinations. We demonstrate the performance of our model in a simple setting using a high-throughput dataset and show that the model is able to efficiently borrow information across outputs.">

        <tr id="Targeted monotherapies for cancer often fail due to inherent or acquired drug resistance. By aiming at multiple targets simultaneously, drug combinations can produce synergistic interactions that increase drug effectiveness and reduce resistance. Computational models based on the integration of omics data have been used to identify synergistic combinations, but predicting drug synergy remains a challenge. Here, we introduce DIPx, an algorithm for personalized prediction of drug synergy based on biologically motivated tumor- and drug-specific pathway activation scores (PASs). We trained and validated DIPx in the AstraZeneca-Sanger (AZS) DREAM Challenge dataset using two separate test sets: Test Set 1 comprised the combinations already present in the training set, while Test Set 2 contained combinations absent from the training set, thus indicating the model’s ability to handle novel combinations. The Spearman correlation coefficients between predicted and observed drug synergy were 0.50 (95% CI: 0.47–0.53) in Test Set 1 and 0.26 (95% CI: 0.22–0.30) in Test Set 2, compared to 0.38 (95% CI: 0.34–0.42) and 0.18 (95% CI: 0.16–0.20), respectively, for the best performing method in the Challenge. We show evidence that higher synergy is associated with higher functional interaction between the drug targets, and this functional interaction information is captured by PAS. We illustrate the use of PAS to provide a potential biological explanation in terms of activated pathways that mediate the synergistic effects of combined drugs. In summary, DIPx can be a useful tool for personalized prediction of drug synergy and exploration of activated pathways related to the effects of combined drugs.">

With the advent of advanced microscopy, detailed images of complex tissue formations involving multiple cell types have become more accessible in recent years. However, deciphering the underlying rules that govern cell movements is far from trivial. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework to estimate the underlying equations of motion from observed trajectories, a pivotal step in decoding such complex dynamics. Our framework integrates graph neural networks with neural differential equations, enabling effective prediction of two-body interactions based on the states of the interacting entities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through two numerical experiments. First, we used a simulated data from a toy model to tune the hyperparameters. Based on the obtained hyperparameters, we then applied this approach to a more complex model that describes interacting cells of cellular slime molds. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the function of two-body interactions, thereby precisely replicating both individual and collective behaviors within these systems.">

        <tr id="Virtual clinical trials (VCTs) are growing in popularity as a tool for quantitatively predicting heterogeneous treatment responses across a population. In the context of a VCT, a plausible patient is an instance of a mathematical model with parameter (or attribute) values chosen to reflect features of the disease and response to treatment for that particular patient. A number of techniques have been introduced to determine the set of model parametrizations to include in a virtual patient cohort. These methodologies generally start with a prior distribution for each model parameter and utilize some criteria to determine whether a parameter set sampled from the priors should be included or excluded from the plausible population. No standard technique exists, however, for generating these prior distributions and choosing the inclusion/exclusion criteria. In this work, we rigorously quantify the impact that VCT design choices have on VCT predictions. Rather than use real data and a complex mathematical model, a spatial model of radiotherapy is used to generate simulated patient data and the mathematical model used to describe the patient data is a two-parameter ordinary differential equations model. This controlled setup allows us to isolate the impact of both the prior distribution and the inclusion/exclusion criteria on both the heterogeneity of plausible populations and on predicted treatment response. We find that the prior distribution, rather than the inclusion/exclusion criteria, has a larger impact on the heterogeneity of the plausible population. Yet, the percent of treatment responders in the plausible population was more sensitive to the inclusion/exclusion criteria utilized. This foundational understanding of the role of virtual clinical trial design should help inform the development of future VCTs that use more complex models and real data.">

        <tr id="Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention in diverse domains, ranging from urban planning to pandemic management. Ensuring both accuracy and robustness in GNNs remains a challenge due to insufficient quality data that contains sufficient features. With sufficient training data where all spatiotemporal patterns are well-represented, existing GNN models can make reasonably accurate predictions. However, existing methods fail when the training data are drawn from different circumstances (e.g., traffic patterns on regular days) than test data (e.g., traffic patterns after a natural disaster). Such challenges are usually classified under domain generalization. In this work, we show that one way to address this challenge in the context of spatiotemporal prediction is by incorporating domain differential equations into graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We theoretically derive conditions where GCNs incorporating such domain differential equations are robust to mismatched training and testing data compared to baseline domain agnostic models. To support our theory, we propose two domain-differential-equation-informed networks: Reaction-Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (RDGCN), which incorporates differential equations for traffic speed evolution, and the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered Graph Convolutional Network (SIRGCN), which incorporates a disease propagation model. Both RDGCN and SIRGCN are based on reliable and interpretable domain differential equations that allow the models to generalize to unseen patterns. We experimentally show that RDGCN and SIRGCN are more robust with mismatched testing data than state-of-the-art deep learning methods.">

However, most progress has focused on proving identifiability results in different settings, and we are not aware of any successful real-world application. At the same time, the field of dynamical systems benefited from deep learning and scaled to countless applications but does not allow parameter identification. In this paper, we draw a clear connection between the two and their key assumptions, allowing us to apply identifiable methods developed in causal representation learning to dynamical systems. At the same time, we can leverage scalable differentiable solvers developed for differential equations to build models that are both identifiable and practical. Overall, we learn explicitly controllable models that isolate the trajectory-specific parameters for further downstream tasks such as out-of-distribution classification or treatment effect estimation. We experiment with a wind simulator with partially known factors of variation. We also apply the resulting model to real-world climate data and successfully answer downstream causal questions in line with existing literature on climate change.">

        <tr id="Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) modeling attempts to describe the time course changes in tumor size for patients undergoing cancer therapy. TGI models present several advantages over traditional exposure-response models that are based explicitly on clinical end points and have become a popular tool in the pharmacometrics community. Unfortunately, the data required to fit TGI models, namely longitudinal tumor measurements, are sparse or often not available in literature or publicly accessible databases. On the contrary, common end points such as progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) are directly derived from longitudinal tumor measurements and are routinely published. To this end, a Bayesian generative model relating underlying tumor dynamics to summary PFS and ORR data is introduced to learn TGI model parameters using only published summary data. The parameterized model can describe the tumor dynamics, quantify treatment effect, and account for differences in the study population. The utility of this model is shown by applying it to several published studies, and learned parameters are combined to simulate an in silico trial of a novel combination therapy in a novel setting.">

        <tr id="Inspired by the advancements in pre-trained Large Language Models, there has been a surge of studies in the Life Sciences focusing on constructing foundation models with large scale single-cell RNA-seq data. These studies typically involve pre-training a transformer model on large-scale single-cell sequencing data, followed by fine-tuning for a variety of downstream tasks, achieving notable performance. However, these models all share a common short-coming: to utilize the transformer architecture, originally designed for textual data, they artificially impose a sequential structure on genes within cells, simplifying the complex interactions between genes. Furthermore, they focus solely on transcriptomic data, neglecting other relevant biological information. To address these issues, here we introduce Cell-Graph Compass (CGC), the first foundational model that leverages graph structures to model single cells and describes cells from multiple perspectives, including transcriptional profiles, gene text summaries, transcription factor regulatory networks, gene co-expression patterns, and gene positional relationships. By incorporating self-attention mechanisms, we pretrained the model on 50 million human single-cell sequencing data, resulting in a robust digital representation of cells. Extensive downstream experiments demonstrate that our approach can capture meaningful biological knowledge and achieve superior results in various problem scenarios, achieving the state-of-the-art (SOTA).">

To overcome these limitations, we introduce VETE (Variational and Explanatory Transcriptomics Encoder), a novel neural network framework that incorporates a variational component to mitigate noise effects and integrates traceable gene ontology into the neural network architecture for encoding cancer transcriptomics data. Key innovations include a local interpretability-guided method for identifying ontology paths, a visualization tool to elucidate biological mechanisms of drug responses, and the application of centralized large scale hyperparameter optimization. VETE demonstrated robust accuracy in cancer cell line classification and drug response prediction. Additionally, it provided traceable biological explanations for both tasks and offers insights into the mechanisms underlying its predictions.

        <tr id="Since the introduction of the first immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), immunotherapy has changed the landscape of molecular therapeutics for cancers. However, ICIs do not work equally well on all cancers and for all patients. There has been a growing interest in using mathematical and computational models to optimize clinical responses. Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been widely used for mechanistic modeling in immuno-oncology and immunotherapy because they allow rapid simulations of temporal changes in the cellular and molecular populations involved. Nonetheless, ODEs cannot describe the spatial structure in the tumor microenvironment or quantify the influence of spatially-dependent characteristics of tumor-immune dynamics. For these reasons, agent-based models (ABMs) have gained popularity because they can model more detailed phenotypic and spatial heterogeneity that better reflect the complexity seen in vivo. In the context of anti-PD-1 ICIs, we compare treatment outcomes simulated from an ODE model and an ABM to show the importance of including spatial components in computational models of cancer immunotherapy. We consider tumor cells of high and low antigenicity and two distinct cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing mechanisms. The preferred mechanism differs based on the antigenicity of tumor cells. Our ABM reveals varied phenotypic shifts within the tumor and spatial organization of tumor and CTLs, despite similarities in key immune parameters, initial conditions of simulation, and early temporal trajectories of the cell populations.">

        <tr id="Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep phenotyping therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2hi CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models are indispensable to the system biology toolkit for studying the structure and behavior of intracellular signaling networks. A common approach to modeling is to develop a system of equations that encode the known biology using approximations and simplifying assumptions. As a result, the same signaling pathway can be represented by multiple models, each with its set of underlying assumptions, which opens up challenges for model selection and decreases certainty in model predictions. Here, we use Bayesian multimodel inference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology models. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we first show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields predictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then show that predictions made with multi-model inference are robust to data uncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing the sample size. Finally, we use multimodel inference to identify a new model to explain experimentally measured sub-cellular location-specific ERK activity dynamics.

        <tr id="e21567 Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) related toxicity is common in melanoma patients, but identifying who will experience toxicity can be challenging. Precision medicine tools that accurately predict ICI toxicity could improve patient outcomes. This study aimed to use Machine Learning (ML) to predict ICI toxicity in patients with melanoma. Methods: 384 datasets were available for patients started on immunotherapy between 2014-2023 in a single, large regional cancer center in Kent, U.K. Raw data was preprocessed using a standard scaling function and one hot encoding, followed by SMOTE to balance the imbalanced classes. Six ML algorithms were developed using 80% of the training data, tested on 20% of validation data and used the Grid Search Cross-Validation technique for hyperparameter optimization. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) explainable artificial intelligence was used to interpret the toxicity prediction model to improve the interpretation and transparency of the decision boundary. Results: Of the 384 patients, 112 patients (29%) had completely resected disease and then had adjuvant treatment while 272 (71%) were unresectable or had metastatic disease and had palliative treatment intent. In the metastatic setting, the commonest immunotherapy regimen was Pembrolizumab (155, 57%), followed by Ipilimumab/Nivolumab (85, 31%). The commonest regimen in the adjuvant setting was Pembrolizumab (86, 77%). 95 patients (25%) experienced ICI-related toxicity. The number of patients with Grades 1-4 toxicity was 2 ,4, 18 and 4 respectively, the remaining had unspecified toxicity grades. The commonest class of toxicity (CTCAE v5) was gastrointestinal (36, 38%), followed by endocrine (20, 21%) and skin (19, 20%). Linear Regression and Gaussian Naïve Bayes predicted toxicity with the most accuracy, 92% (Table 1). The model showed that increasing age, female gender and not receiving Nivolumab predicted toxicity. Regardless of the regimen or treatment intent, our ML model could also predict immunotherapy response with 90% accuracy. Conclusions: These ML algorithms used clinically available data to predict ICI toxicity accurately. Key predictors of toxicity included increasing age, female gender and not receiving Nivolumab in the setting of both adjuvant and palliative intent. Future work will aim to externally validate these models in other centers. We will also explore if models could be trained for use in patients treated with nivolumab in combination with new anti-LAG-3(relatlimab). [Table: see text]">

Despite this uptake, there are only a few automated packages to aid their development and deployment that also support uncertainty estimation, model explainability, and other key aspects of model usage. This represents a key unmet need within the field, and the large number of molecular representations and algorithms (and associated parameters) means it is nontrivial to robustly optimize, evaluate, reproduce, and deploy models. Here, we present QSARtuna, a molecule property prediction modeling pipeline, written in Python and utilizing the Optuna, Scikit-learn, RDKit, and ChemProp packages, which enables the efficient and automated comparison between molecular representations and machine learning models. The platform was developed by considering the increasingly important aspect of model uncertainty quantification and explainability by design. We provide details for our framework and provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the capability of the software when applied to simple molecular property, reaction/reactivity prediction, and DNA encoded library enrichment classification. We hope that the release of QSARtuna will further spur innovation in automatic ML modeling and provide a platform for education of best practices in molecular property modeling. The code for the QSARtuna framework is made freely available via GitHub.">

This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors.

Despite the advances in high-throughput technologies, large-scale experiments typically remain prohibitively expensive. Here we introduce a machine learning platform, structure-augmented regression (SAR), that exploits the intrinsic structure of each biological system to learn a high-accuracy model with minimal data requirement. Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments. Our approach has implications for predictive control of biological systems and an integration of machine learning prediction and experimental design.">

However, current molecular representation learning methods do not provide a comprehensive view of cell states under these perturbations and struggle to remove noise, hindering model generalization. We introduce the Information Alignment (InfoAlign) approach to learn molecular representations through the information bottleneck method in cells. We integrate molecules and cellular response data as nodes into a context graph, connecting them with weighted edges based on chemical, biological, and computational criteria. For each molecule in a training batch, InfoAlign optimizes the encoder’s latent representation with a minimality objective to discard redundant structural information. A sufficiency objective decodes the representation to align with different feature spaces from the molecule’s neighborhood in the context graph. We demonstrate that the proposed sufficiency objective for alignment is tighter than existing encoder-based contrastive methods. Empirically, we validate representations from InfoAlign in two downstream tasks: molecular property prediction against up to 19 baseline methods across four datasets, plus zero-shot molecule-morphology matching.">

        <tr id="Generative modeling of single-cell RNA-seq data has shown invaluable potential in community-driven tasks such as trajectory inference, batch effect removal and gene expression generation. However, most recent deep models generating synthetic single cells from noise operate on pre-processed continuous gene expression approximations, ignoring the inherently discrete and over-dispersed nature of single-cell data, which limits downstream applications and hinders the incorporation of robust noise models. Moreover, crucial aspects of deep-learning-based synthetic single-cell generation remain underexplored, such as controllable multi-modal and multi-label generation and its role in the performance enhancement of downstream tasks. This work presents Cell Flow for Generation (CFGen), a flow-based conditional generative model for multi-modal single-cell counts, which explicitly accounts for the discrete nature of the data. Our results suggest improved recovery of crucial biological data characteristics while accounting for novel generative tasks such as conditioning on multiple attributes and boosting rare cell type classification via data augmentation. By showcasing CFGen on a diverse set of biological datasets and settings, we provide evidence of its value to the fields of computational biology and deep generative models.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

        <tr id="In drug candidate design, clearance is one of the most crucial pharmacokinetic parameters to consider. Recent advancements in machine learning techniques coupled with the growing accumulation of drug data have paved the way for the construction of computational models to predict drug clearance. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of data collected from public sources, and a majority of current in silico quantitative structure-property relationship models tend to neglect the influence of molecular chirality. In this study, we meticulously examined human liver microsome (HLM) data from public databases and constructed two distinct data sets with varying HLM data quantity and quality. Two baseline models (RF and DNN) and three chirality-focused GNNs (DMPNN, TetraDMPNN, and ChIRo) were proposed, and their performance on HLM data was evaluated and compared with each other. The TetraDMPNN model, which leverages chirality from 2D structure, exhibited the best performance with a test R2 of 0.639 and a test root-mean-squared error of 0.429. The applicability domain of the model was also defined by using a molecular similarity-based method.

Recently developed methods, such as those based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and Transformers, demonstrate exceptional performance across various datasets by effectively extracting structural information. However, the benchmarking of these novel methods often varies significantly in terms of hyperparameter settings and datasets, which limits algorithmic progress. In view of these, we conduct a comprehensive survey and benchmark for drug-target interaction modeling from a structure perspective, via integrating tens of explicit (i.e., GNN-based) and implicit (i.e., Transformer-based) structure learning algorithms. To this end, we first unify the hyperparameter setting within each class of structure learning methods. Moreover, we conduct a macroscopical comparison between these two classes of encoding strategies as well as the different featurization techniques that inform molecules' chemical and physical properties. We then carry out the microscopical comparison between all the integrated models across the six datasets, via comprehensively benchmarking their effectiveness and efficiency. Remarkably, the summarized insights from the benchmark studies lead to the design of model combos. We demonstrate that our combos can achieve new state-of-the-art performance on various datasets associated with cost-effective memory and computation.

        <tr id="The live identification of emergent behavior in complex systems with little a-priori information is a challenging task and existing approaches are either applicable to a small subset of models or do not scale well. In contrast, post-mortem approaches that have a more in-depth understanding of the characteristics of emergent properties often struggle with analyzing a large amount of data to extract relationships between the variables, events, and entities whose interaction eventually leads to emergent behavior. Machine learning approaches have been promoted as potential replacements of existing approaches, due to their ability to analyze large amounts of data without a-priori knowledge of existing relationships. In this paper, we present a first step towards the use of supervised learning approaches to identify and predict emergent behavior. Our hybrid approach unifies live and post-mortem perspectives by relying on a visual inspection of the simulation run and the simulation data set to identify a set of features that are more likely to generate emergent behavior (post-mortem) which are then used by a machine learning module to predict emergent behavior (live). Our analysis shows the potential of such approaches but also highlights challenges and future avenues of research.">

However, BFNs cannot learn high-level semantic representation from the parameter space since {common encoders, which encode data into one static representation, cannot capture semantic changes in parameters.} This motivates a new direction: learning semantic representations hidden in the parameter spaces to characterize mixed-typed noisy data. {Accordingly, we propose a representation learning framework named ParamReL, which operates in the parameter space to obtain parameter-wise latent semantics that exhibit progressive structures. Specifically, ParamReL proposes a \emph{self-}encoder to learn latent semantics directly from parameters, rather than from observations. The encoder is then integrated into BFNs, enabling representation learning with various formats of observations. Mutual information terms further promote the disentanglement of latent semantics and capture meaningful semantics simultaneously.} We illustrate {conditional generation and reconstruction} in ParamReL via expanding BFNs, and extensive {quantitative} experimental results demonstrate the {superior effectiveness} of ParamReL in learning parameter representation.">

        <tr id="Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

        <tr id="In a landscape where scientific discovery is increasingly driven by data, the integration of machine learning (ML) with traditional scientific methodologies has emerged as a transformative approach. This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

In this study, we tested multi-task machine learning (ML) models to predict ADME and animal PK endpoints trained on in-house data generated at Boehringer Ingelheim. Models were evaluated both at the design stage of a compound (i. e., no experimental data of test compounds available) and at testing stage when a particular assay would be conducted (i. e., experimental data of earlier conducted assays may be available). Using realistic time-splits, we found a clear benefit in performance of multi-task graph-based neural network models over single-task model, which was even stronger when experimental data of earlier assays is available. In an attempt to explain the success of multi-task models, we found that especially endpoints with the largest numbers of data points (physicochemical endpoints, clearance in microsomes) are responsible for increased predictivity in more complex ADME and PK endpoints. In summary, our study provides insight into how data for multiple ADME/PK endpoints in a pharmaceutical company can be best leveraged to optimize predictivity of ML models.">

        <tr id="Abstract Inferring gene regulatory networks (GRNs) allows us to obtain a deeper understanding of cellular function and disease pathogenesis. Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology have improved the accuracy of GRN inference. However, many methods for inferring individual GRNs from scRNA-seq data are limited because they overlook intercellular heterogeneity and similarities between different cell subpopulations, which are often present in the data. Here, we propose a deep learning-based framework, DeepGRNCS, for jointly inferring GRNs across cell subpopulations. We follow the commonly accepted hypothesis that the expression of a target gene can be predicted based on the expression of transcription factors (TFs) due to underlying regulatory relationships. We initially processed scRNA-seq data by discretizing data scattering using the equal-width method. Then, we trained deep learning models to predict target gene expression from TFs. By individually removing each TF from the expression matrix, we used pre-trained deep model predictions to infer regulatory relationships between TFs and genes, thereby constructing the GRN. Our method outperforms existing GRN inference methods for various simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. Finally, we applied DeepGRNCS to non-small cell lung cancer scRNA-seq data to identify key genes in each cell subpopulation and analyzed their biological relevance. In conclusion, DeepGRNCS effectively predicts cell subpopulation-specific GRNs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Nastume777/DeepGRNCS.">

This study involves extensive preprocessing of laboratory measurement data, prescription data and patient data. The resulting machine learning models predict potential abnormalities across 20 selected measurement items (e.g., concentrations of metabolites and blood cells) in the form of a sentence. The models showed an average AUROC of 0.75, and age, specific active pharmaceutical ingredients, and gender appeared to be the most influential features.

Despite these advances, the inherent diversity of cells and data challenges such as noise, batch effects, and sparsity, underscores the pressing need for a unified model to learn and represent cellular states effectively. Single-cell Large Language Models (LLMs) have been crafted to bridge this gap yet exhibit limited performance on human cells. This short-fall may stem from the confounding effects of training data from diverse species, partly because of limited cells for the single species. Here, we have compiled a dataset of approximately 100 million human cells sequenced by multiple technolo-gies from human single-cell datasets with various file types deposited in public databases and websites. Leveraging these extensive data cohorts, we developed CellFM, a robust single-cell foundation model with an impressive 800 million parameters, marking an eight-fold increase over the current largest single-species model. To ensure the training of CellFM on the MindSpore AI framework from Huawei, we have integrated RetNet, a Transformer architecture variant with lin-ear complexity for a balance between efficiency and performance, serving as the backbone of our model. Our comprehensive experiments have shown that CellFM outperforms existing models across diverse applications, such as cell annotation, perturbation prediction, and gene function prediction.">

        <tr id="Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are often characterised by heterogeneity in presentation. The traditional approach to diseases guided by their phenotype may be suboptimal with the advent of precision medicine. Precision medicine is the integration and application of multiomics to predict the best-performing drug and its toxicity profile to derive optimal benefits. With novel drug discoveries and an expanding therapeutic armamentarium, it potentially aids in clinical and therapeutic decision-making, while saving time and averting adverse events. However, multiomics comes with ‘big data’, and owing to the costs, the sample size is usually small. Machine learning (ML) plays an important role in these scenarios where conventional statistics fall short. So, by integrating clinical data with the data from -omics, ML models can be built, which can accurately predict the clinical factors or even novel biomarkers that predict response. This approach has a potential for great benefit as valuable time or the ‘therapeutic window of opportunity’ would be saved, with fewer adverse events, eventually translating to lower damage accrual and better outcomes. Most of the evidence for the use of ML in precision rheumatology comes from rheumatoid arthritis and the factors predicting response to various drugs, including tumour necrosis factor inhibitors. This approach also has its limitations such as the lack of generalizability and the current scarcity of longitudinal data. These models must be tested in larger cohorts and population-based studies for validation, failing which there is a risk of apparent identification of multiple ‘novel’ biomarkers that may or may not be mechanistic.">

This paper introduces DeepFusionCDR, a novel approach employing unsupervised contrastive learning to amalgamate multi-omics features, including mutation, transcriptome, methylome, and copy number variation data, from cell lines. Furthermore, we incorporate molecular SMILES-specific transformers to derive drug features from their chemical structures. The unified multi-omics and drug signatures are combined, and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is applied to predict IC50 values for cell line-drug pairs. Moreover, this MLP can discern whether a cell line is resistant or sensitive to a particular drug. We assessed DeepFusionCDR's performance on the GDSC dataset and juxtaposed it against cutting-edge methods, demonstrating its superior performance in regression and classification tasks. We also conducted ablation studies and case analyses to exhibit the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed approach. Our results underscore the potential of DeepFusionCDR to enhance CDR predictions by harnessing the power of multi-omics fusion and molecular-specific transformers.

Methods: Concr adapted Bayesian statistical principles used by astrophysicists to effectively integrate multi-dimensional data (genomic & transcriptomic) for accurate modelling of cancer biology. Our proprietary computational framework was applied to predict clinical response and survival through construction of digital twins and in silico simulations of clinical trials. Predicted log odds ratios (LOR) were generated for drug response and compared to published data from 8 suitable historical clinical trials. Three distinct models underpin this framework: Drug Efficacy, Treatment Response & Overall Survival (OS). Three publicly available datasets were used for training: Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal ( in vitro dose-response data), Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia and TCGA. Results: For all 8 clinical studies, the digital twin model accurately simulated both trial arms, compared drug efficacy across arms and predicted which treatment was most active. Unblinded evaluation: Our model accurately predicted gemcitabine would have greater clinical benefit than 5-FU (LOR -0.10, P <0.0001) in metastatic pancreatic cancer. In advanced breast cancer, the model predicted docetaxel had a higher response rate than doxorubicin, and carboplatin response rates were similar to docetaxel in BRCA wild-type patients. In platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, the model predicted cisplatin-based combination had a higher response rate than paclitaxel. Blinded evaluation: Using data for paclitaxel, the model correctly predicted that nab-paclitaxel+gemcitabine response rates were higher than gemcitabine in metastatic pancreatic cancer (predicted LOR -0.090, p = <0.001). In all 3 early breast cancer studies, predictions mirrored clinical trial results, adjuvant ECF > CMF, adjuvant TC > AC and adjuvant tamoxifen was superior to capecitabine. The underlying pan-tumour Overall Survival model used a Random Survival Forest approach, trained on 23 cancers with predictive accuracy of 0.78 AUC ROC and C-index 0.71. To enable cohort enrichment for drug response, the model segmented patient cohorts into treatment responder and non-responder. Using this approach, the log odds increased for drug response rate for 16 of the 19 different cancers and 14 of the different 17 drugs. Conclusions: Our digital twin model represents transformative technology for clinical trial simulation with strong potential for accelerating and de-risking clinical drug development, and utility for synthetic control arms.">

        <tr id="Circulating tumor DNA assays are promising tools for the prediction of cancer treatment response. Here, we build a framework for the design of ctDNA biomarkers of therapy response that incorporate variations in ctDNA dynamics driven by specific treatment mechanisms. We develop mathematical models of ctDNA kinetics driven by tumor response to several therapy classes, and utilize them to simulate randomized virtual patient cohorts to test candidate biomarkers. Using this approach, we propose specific biomarkers, based on ctDNA longitudinal features, for targeted therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of these biomarkers in predicting treatment response within a randomized virtual patient cohort dataset. These biomarkers are based on novel proposals for ctDNA sampling protocols, consisting of frequent sampling within a compact time window surrounding therapy initiation – which we hypothesize to hold valuable prognostic information on longer-term treatment response. This study highlights a need for tailoring ctDNA sampling protocols and interpretation methodology to specific biological mechanisms of therapy response, and it provides a novel modeling and simulation framework for doing so. In addition, it highlights the potential of ctDNA assays for making early, rapid predictions of treatment response within the first days or weeks of treatment, and generates hypotheses for further clinical testing.">

        <tr id="Paired single-cell sequencing technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of complementary modalities of molecular data at single-cell resolution. Along with the advances in these technologies, many methods based on variational autoencoders have been developed to integrate these data. However, these methods do not explicitly incorporate prior biological relationships between the data modalities, which could significantly enhance modeling and interpretation. We propose a novel probabilistic learning framework that explicitly incorporates conditional independence relationships between multi-modal data as a directed acyclic graph using a generalized hierarchical variational autoencoder. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework across various applications pertinent to single-cell multi-omics data integration. These include the isolation of common and distinct information from different modalities, modality-specific differential analysis, and integrated cell clustering. We anticipate that the proposed framework can facilitate the construction of highly flexible graphical models that can capture the complexities of biological hypotheses and unravel the connections between different biological data types, such as different modalities of paired single-cell multi-omics data. The implementation of the proposed framework can be found in the repository https://github.com/kuijjerlab/CAVACHON.">

        <tr id="OBJECTIVE
The aim of this project was to create time-aware, individual-level risk score models for adverse drug events related to multiple sclerosis disease-modifying therapy and to provide interpretable explanations for model prediction behavior.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used temporal sequences of observational medical outcomes partnership common data model (OMOP CDM) concepts derived from an electronic health record as model features. Each concept was assigned an embedding representation that was learned from a graph convolution network trained on a knowledge graph (KG) of OMOP concept relationships. Concept embeddings were fed into long short-term memory networks for 1-year adverse event prediction following drug exposure. Finally, we implemented a novel extension of the local interpretable model agnostic explanation (LIME) method, knowledge graph LIME (KG-LIME) to leverage the KG and explain individual predictions of each model.


RESULTS
For a set of 4859 patients, we found that our model was effective at predicting 32 out of 56 adverse event types (P < .05) when compared to demographics and past diagnosis as variables. We also assessed discrimination in the form of area under the curve (AUC = 0.77 ± 0.15) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR = 0.31 ± 0.27) and assessed calibration in the form of Brier score (BS = 0.04 ± 0.04). Additionally, KG-LIME generated interpretable literature-validated lists of relevant medical concepts used for prediction.


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Many of our risk models demonstrated high calibration and discrimination for adverse event prediction. Furthermore, our novel KG-LIME method was able to utilize the knowledge graph to highlight concepts that were important to prediction. Future work will be required to further explore the temporal window of adverse event occurrence beyond the generic 1-year window used here, particularly for short-term inpatient adverse events and long-term severe adverse events.">

While diffusion models have excelled in generating various objects, generating graphs remains challenging. This thesis explores the potential of score-based generative models in generating such objects through a modelization as combinatorial complexes, which are powerful topological structures that encompass higher-order relationships. In this thesis, we propose a unified framework by employing stochastic differential equations. We not only generalize the generation of complex objects such as graphs and hypergraphs, but we also unify existing generative modelling approaches such as Score Matching with Langevin dynamics and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. This innovation overcomes limitations in existing frameworks that focus solely on graph generation, opening up new possibilities in generative AI. The experiment results showed that our framework could generate these complex objects, and could also compete against state-of-the-art approaches for mere graph and molecule generation tasks.">

        <tr id="In this work, we introduce a novel application of foundation models in the domain of nonlinear chemical process modeling. Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

This study combines Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) with the Cox model to enhance the model's performance in analyzing recurrent events with dynamic temporal information. Compared to classical models, the LSTM-Cox model significantly improves the accuracy of extracting clinical risk features and exhibits lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values, while maintaining good performance on simulated datasets. In an empirical analysis of bladder cancer recurrence data, the model successfully reduced the mean squared error during the training phase and achieved a Concordance index of up to 0.90 on the test set. Furthermore, the model effectively distinguished between high and low-risk patient groups, and the identified recurrence risk features such as the number of tumor recurrences and maximum size were consistent with other research and clinical trial results. This study not only provides a straightforward and efficient method for analyzing recurrent data and extracting features but also offers a convenient pathway for integrating deep learning techniques into clinical risk prediction systems.">

        <tr id="During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells fold into specific structures, is a central question in biology that defines how living organisms form. Establishing tissue-level morphology critically relies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its neighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over time during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a geometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and embryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks. We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D morphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements before they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation map and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction networks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for embryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study morphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power of geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of cells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic morphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as embryogenesis.">

In this study, we focus on leveraging ML methodologies to address the longstanding issues surrounding the prediction and treatment of Parkinson's Disease (PD). PD prediction has historically suffered from inaccuracies and inconsistent treatments. Our research aims to mitigate these challenges by developing a predictive system tailored specifically to PD datasets. To achieve this, we systematically explore various ML algorithms for binary classification tasks, comparing their efficacy in predicting PD. By analyzing and comparing the performance of these algorithms, we aim to establish a robust pathway for accurately examining and diagnosing PD, thereby reducing discrepancies and associated risks. Our findings underscore the importance of employing ML techniques in developing effective decision support systems for PD prediction. By synthesizing results from multiple algorithms, our study not only contributes to filling existing research gaps but also provides actionable insights for the development of advanced medical applications. Overall, this research offers a comprehensive evaluation of ML approaches in the context of PD prediction, highlighting their potential to revolutionize diagnostic processes and improve patient outcomes.

        <tr id="This study proposes a novel long short-term memory (LSTM)-based model for predicting future physical properties based on partial data of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. It extracts latent vectors from atomic coordinates of MD simulations using graph convolutional network, utilizes LSTM to learn temporal trends in latent vectors and make one-step-ahead predictions of physical properties through fully connected layers. Validating with MD simulations of Ni solid-liquid systems, the model achieved accurate one-step-ahead prediction for time variation of the potential energy during solidification and melting processes using residual connections. Recursive use of predicted values enabled long-term prediction from just the first 20 snapshots of the MD simulation. The prediction has captured the feature of potential energy bending at low temperatures, which represents completion of solidification, despite that the MD data in short time do not have such a bending characteristic. Remarkably, for long-time prediction over 900 ps, the computation time was reduced to 1/700th of a full MD simulation of the same duration. This approach has shown the potential to significantly reduce computational cost for prediction of physical properties by efficiently utilizing the data of MD simulation.">

Maximizing the use of all available data and information about the drug enables a more robust characterization of the risk-benefit profile and reduces uncertainty in both technical and regulatory success. This offers the potential to transform rare diseases drug development, where conducting large well-controlled clinical trials is impractical and/or unethical due to a small patient population, a significant portion of which could be children. Additionally, the totality of evidence generated by model-informed approaches can provide confirmatory evidence for regulatory approval without the need for additional clinical data.

Predicting hERG blockade is essential for identifying cardiac safety issues. Various QSAR models exist, but their performance varies. Ongoing improvements show promise, necessitating continued efforts to enhance accuracy using emerging deep learning algorithms in predicting potential hERG blockade.


STUDY DESIGN AND METHOD
Using a large training dataset, six individual QSAR models were developed. Additionally, three ensemble models were constructed. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validations and two external datasets.


RESULTS
The 10-fold cross-validations resulted in Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) values from 0.682 to 0.730, surpassing the best-reported model on the same dataset (0.689). External validations yielded MCC values from 0.520 to 0.715 for the first dataset, exceeding those of previously reported models (0 - 0.599). For the second dataset, MCC values fell between 0.025 and 0.215, aligning with those of reported models (0.112 - 0.220).


CONCLUSIONS
The developed models can assist the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies in predicting hERG blockage activity, thereby enhancing safety assessments and reducing the risk of adverse cardiac events associated with new drug candidates.">

        <tr id="Cellular metabolism is a highly interconnected network with thousands of reactions that convert nutrients into the molecular building blocks of life. Metabolic connectivity varies greatly with cellular context and environmental conditions, and it remains a challenge to compare genome-scale metabolism across cell types because of the high dimensionality of the reaction flux space. Here, we employ self-supervised learning and genome-scale metabolic models to compress the flux space into low-dimensional representations that preserve structure across cell types. We trained variational autoencoders (VAEs) on large fluxomic data (N = 800, 000) sampled from patient-derived models for various cancer cell types. The VAE embeddings have an improved ability to distinguish cell types than the uncompressed fluxomic data, and sufficient predictive power to classify cell types with high accuracy. We tested the ability of these classifiers to assign cell type identities to unlabelled patient-derived metabolic models not employed during VAE training. We further employed the pre-trained VAE to embed another 38 cell types and trained multilabel classifiers that display promising generalization performance. Our approach distils the metabolic space into a semantically rich vector that can be used as a foundation for predictive modelling, clustering or comparing metabolic capabilities across organisms.">

        <tr id="Abstract Reconstructing the topology of gene regulatory network from gene expression data has been extensively studied. With the abundance functional transcriptomic data available, it is now feasible to systematically decipher regulatory interaction dynamics in a logic form such as a Boolean network (BN) framework, which qualitatively indicates how multiple regulators aggregated to affect a common target gene. However, inferring both the network topology and gene interaction dynamics simultaneously is still a challenging problem since gene expression data are typically noisy and data discretization is prone to information loss. We propose a new method for BN inference from time-series transcriptional profiles, called LogicGep. LogicGep formulates the identification of Boolean functions as a symbolic regression problem that learns the Boolean function expression and solve it efficiently through multi-objective optimization using an improved gene expression programming algorithm. To avoid overly emphasizing dynamic characteristics at the expense of topology structure ones, as traditional methods often do, a set of promising Boolean formulas for each target gene is evolved firstly, and a feed-forward neural network trained with continuous expression data is subsequently employed to pick out the final solution. We validated the efficacy of LogicGep using multiple datasets including both synthetic and real-world experimental data. The results elucidate that LogicGep adeptly infers accurate BN models, outperforming other representative BN inference algorithms in both network topology reconstruction and the identification of Boolean functions. Moreover, the execution of LogicGep is hundreds of times faster than other methods, especially in the case of large network inference.">

        <tr id="Many real-world systems can be represented as sets of interacting components. Examples of such systems include computational systems such as query processors, natural systems such as cells, and social systems such as families. Many approaches have been proposed in traditional (associational) machine learning to model such structured systems, including statistical relational models and graph neural networks. Despite this prior work, existing approaches to estimating causal effects typically treat such systems as single units, represent them with a fixed set of variables and assume a homogeneous data-generating process. We study a compositional approach for estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) in structured systems, where each unit is represented by the composition of multiple heterogeneous components. This approach uses a modular architecture to model potential outcomes at each component and aggregates component-level potential outcomes to obtain the unit-level potential outcomes. We discover novel benefits of the compositional approach in causal inference - systematic generalization to estimate counterfactual outcomes of unseen combinations of components and improved overlap guarantees between treatment and control groups compared to the classical methods for causal effect estimation. We also introduce a set of novel environments for empirically evaluating the compositional approach and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and real-world data.">

        <tr id="Cells must adopt flexible regulatory strategies to make decisions regarding their fate, including differentiation, apoptosis, or survival in the face of various external stimuli. One key cellular strategy that enables these functions is stochastic gene expression programs. However, understanding how transcriptional bursting, and consequently, cell fate, responds to DNA damage on a genome-wide scale poses a challenge. In this study, we propose an interpretable and scalable inference framework, DeepTX, that leverages deep learning methods to connect mechanistic models and scRNA-seq data, thereby revealing genome-wide transcriptional burst kinetics. This framework enables rapid and accurate solutions to transcription models and the inference of transcriptional burst kinetics from scRNA-seq data. Applying this framework to several scRNA-seq datasets of DNA-damaging drug treatments, we observed that fluctuations in transcriptional bursting induced by different drugs could lead to distinct fate decisions: IdU treatment induces differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells by increasing the burst size of gene expression, while 5FU treatment with low and high dose increases the burst frequency of gene expression to induce cell apoptosis and survival in human colon cancer cells. Together, these results show that DeepTX can be used to analyze single-cell transcriptomics data and can provide mechanistic insights into cell fate decisions.">

Advances in CSL now allow learning of causal graphs in diverse application domains, which has the potential to facilitate data-driven causal decision-making. Real-world CSL performance depends on a number of $\textit{context-specific}$ factors, including context-specific data distributions and non-linear dependencies, that are important in practical use-cases. However, our understanding of how to assess and select CSL methods in specific contexts remains limited. To address this gap, we present $\textit{CausalRegNet}$, a multiplicative effect structural causal model that allows for generating observational and interventional data incorporating context-specific properties, with a focus on the setting of gene perturbation experiments. Using real-world gene perturbation data, we show that CausalRegNet generates accurate distributions and scales far better than current simulation frameworks. We illustrate the use of CausalRegNet in assessing CSL methods in the context of interventional experiments in biology.">

        <tr id="Machine learning has been proposed as an alternative to theoretical modeling when dealing with complex problems in biological physics. However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is “learnable” and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

The incidence of ischemic stroke has been steadily increasing globally, and its disease mechanisms are highly complex and involve a multitude of biological mechanisms at various scales from genes all the way to the human body system that can affect the stroke onset, progression, treatment, and prognosis. To complement conventional experimental research methods, computational systems biology modeling can integrate and describe the pathogenic mechanisms of ischemic stroke across multiple biological scales and help identify emergent modulatory principles that drive disease progression and recovery. In addition, by running virtual experiments and trials in computers, these models can efficiently predict and evaluate outcomes of different treatment methods and thereby assist clinical decision-making. In this review, we summarize the current research and application of systems-level computational modeling in the field of ischemic stroke from the multiscale mechanism-based, physics-based and omics-based perspectives and discuss how modeling-driven research frameworks can deliver insights for future stroke research and drug development.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed deep learning has been developed as a novel paradigm for learning physical dynamics recently. While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

To facilitate the design of dosing regimens and identification of potential biomarkers for immunotherapy, we developed a new computational model to track tumor progression at the organ scale while capturing the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor in HCC. This computational model of spatial quantitative systems pharmacology (spQSP) was designed to simulate the effects of combination immunotherapy. The model was initiated using literature-derived parameter values and fitted to the specifics of HCC. Model validation was done through comparison to spatial multi-omics data from a neoadjuvant HCC clinical trial combining anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) cabozantinib. Validation using spatial proteomics data from Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) demonstrated that closer proximity between CD8 T cells and macrophages correlated with non-response. We also compared the model output with Visium spatial transcriptomics (ST) profiling of samples from post-treatment tumor resections in the clinical trial and from another independent study of anti-PD1 monotherapy. ST data confirmed simulation results, suggesting the importance of spatial patterns of tumor vasculature and TGFβ in tumor and immune cell interactions.

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points. Evaluations in a simulated environment with real-world data show PhyGICS outperforms a regular PINN model and other baseline control strategies on: 1) thermal model accuracy; 2) computation time; 3) energy consumption; and 4) user comfort.">

        <tr id="Differentiable causal discovery has made significant advancements in the learning of directed acyclic graphs. However, its application to real-world datasets remains restricted due to the ubiquity of latent confounders and the requirement to learn maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs). To date, existing differentiable MAG learning algorithms have been limited to small datasets and failed to scale to larger ones (e.g., with more than 50 variables). The key insight in this paper is that the causal skeleton, which is the undirected version of the causal graph, has potential for improving accuracy and reducing the search space of the optimization procedure, thereby enhancing the performance of differentiable causal discovery. Therefore, we seek to address a two-fold challenge to harness the potential of the causal skeleton for differentiable causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders: (1) scalable and accurate estimation of skeleton and (2) universal integration of skeleton estimation with differentiable causal discovery. To this end, we propose SPOT (Skeleton Posterior-guided OpTimization), a two-phase framework that harnesses skeleton posterior for differentiable causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders. On the contrary to a ``point-estimation'', SPOT seeks to estimate the posterior distribution of skeletons given the dataset. It first formulates the posterior inference as an instance of amortized inference problem and concretizes it with a supervised causal learning (SCL)-enabled solution to estimate the skeleton posterior. To incorporate the skeleton posterior with differentiable causal discovery, SPOT then features a skeleton posterior-guided stochastic optimization procedure to guide the optimization of MAGs.

        <tr id="Real-world data generation often involves certain geometries (e.g., graphs) that induce instance-level interdependence. This characteristic makes the generalization of learning models more difficult due to the intricate interdependent patterns that impact data-generative distributions and can vary from training to testing. In this work, we propose a geometric diffusion model with learnable divergence fields for the challenging generalization problem with interdependent data. We generalize the diffusion equation with stochastic diffusivity at each time step, which aims to capture the multi-faceted information flows among interdependent data. Furthermore, we derive a new learning objective through causal inference, which can guide the model to learn generalizable patterns of interdependence that are insensitive across domains. Regarding practical implementation, we introduce three model instantiations that can be considered as the generalized versions of GCN, GAT, and Transformers, respectively, which possess advanced robustness against distribution shifts. We demonstrate their promising efficacy for out-of-distribution generalization on diverse real-world datasets.">

This innovative strategy incorporates graph features, encompassing both regulatory and structural elements. The regulatory elements include pair-wise gene correlation, biological pathways, protein-protein interaction networks, and transcription factor regulation.

Principal Node Aggregation models, validated independently, emerge as frontrunners, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional regression and other deep learning models.

        <tr id="Molecular simulations enable the prediction of physicochemical properties of mixtures based on pair-interaction models of the pure components and combining rules to describe the unlike interactions. However, if no adjustment to experimental data is made, the existing combining rules often do not yield sufficiently accurate predictions of mixture data. To address this problem, adjustable binary parameters ξij describing the pair interactions in mixtures (i + j) are used. In this work, we present the first method for predicting ξij for unstudied mixtures based on a matrix completion method (MCM) from machine learning (ML). Considering molecular simulations of Henry's law constants as an example, we demonstrate that ξij for unstudied mixtures can be predicted with high accuracy. Using the predicted ξij significantly increases the accuracy of the Henry's law constant predictions compared to using the default ξij = 1. Our approach is generic and can be transferred to molecular simulations of other mixture properties and even to combining rules in equations of state, granting predictive access to the description of unlike intermolecular interactions.">

        <tr id="Molecular analytics increasingly utilize machine learning (ML) for predictive modeling based on data acquired through molecular profiling technologies. However, developing robust models that accurately capture physiological phenotypes is challenged by a multitude of factors. These include the dynamics inherent to biological systems, variability stemming from analytical procedures, and the resource-intensive nature of obtaining sufficiently representative datasets. Here, we propose and evaluate a new method: Contextual Out-of-Distribution Integration (CODI). Based on experimental observations, CODI generates synthetic data that integrate unrepresented sources of variation encountered in real-world applications into a given molecular fingerprint dataset. By augmenting a dataset with out-of-distribution variance, CODI enables an ML model to better generalize to samples beyond the initial training data. Using three independent longitudinal clinical studies and a case-control study, we demonstrate CODI’s application to several classification scenarios involving vibrational spectroscopy of human blood. We showcase our approach’s ability to enable personalized fingerprinting for multi-year longitudinal molecular monitoring and enhance the robustness of trained ML models for improved disease detection. Our comparative analyses revealed that incorporating CODI into the classification workflow consistently led to significantly improved classification accuracy while minimizing the requirement of collecting extensive experimental observations. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Analyzing molecular fingerprint data is challenging due to multiple sources of biological and analytical variability. This variability hinders the capacity to collect sufficiently large and representative datasets that encompass realistic data distributions. Consequently, the development of machine learning models that generalize to unseen, independently collected samples is often compromised. Here, we introduce CODI, a versatile framework that enhances traditional classifier training methodologies. CODI is a general framework that incorporates information about possible out-of-distribution variations into a given training dataset, augmenting it with simulated samples that better capture the true distribution of the data. This allows the classification to achieve improved predictive performance on samples beyond the original distribution of the training data.">

Current approaches focus on leveraging heterogeneous data, such as drug-protein and disease-protein interactions, to construct complex networks that link drugs, proteins, and diseases. However, a significant challenge is the imbalance in data, where numerous unconfirmed potential drug-disease interactions (the majority class) outnumber approved drugs (the minority class), severely impacting the predictive performance of machine learning models. Previous attempts to address this issue have shown limited success. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates meta-paths in heterogeneous information networks with data balancing techniques to tackle this imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances model performance and reliability in identifying new relationships between drugs and diseases. This research represents a promising advancement by leveraging network-based strategies and data balancing techniques to facilitate the rediscovery of drug applications, thereby potentially revolutionizing the pharmaceutical industry’s approach to drug development.">

        <tr id="Capturing the time evolution and predicting future kinetic states of physicochemical systems present significant challenges due to the precision and computational effort required. In this study, we demonstrate that the transformer, a machine learning model renowned for machine translation and natural language processing, can be effectively adapted to predict the dynamical state-to-state transition kinetics of biologically relevant physicochemical systems. Specifically, by using sequences of time-discretized states from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories as input, we show that a transformer can learn the complex syntactic and semantic relationships within the trajectory. This enables this generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to predict kinetically accurate sequences of future states for a diverse set of models and biomolecules of varying complexity. Remarkably, the GPT can predict future states much faster than traditional MD simulations. We show that it is particularly adept at forecasting the time evolution of an out-of-equilibrium active system that do not maintain detailed balance. An analysis of self-attention mechanism inherent in transformers is found to hold crucial role for capturing the long-range correlations necessary for accurate state-to-state transition predictions. Together, our results highlight the ability of transformer based machine learning model in generating future states of physicochemical systems with statistical precision.">

        <tr id="We address the problem of model misspecification in population pharmacokinetics (PopPK), by modeling residual unexplained variability (RUV) by machine learning (ML) methods in a postprocessing step after conventional model building. The practical purpose of the method is the generation of realistic virtual patient profiles and the quantification of the extent of model misspecification, by introducing an appropriate metric, to be used as an additional diagnostic of model quality. The proposed methodology consists of the following steps: After developing a PopPK model, the individual residual errors IRES = DV-IPRED, are computed, where DV are the observations and IPRED the individual predictions and are modeled by ML to obtain IRESML. Correction of the IPREDs can then be carried out as DVML = IPRED + IRESML. The methodology was tested in a PK study of ropinirole, for which a PopPK model was developed while a second deliberately misspecified model was also considered. Various supervised ML algorithms were tested, among which Random Forest gave the best results. The ML model was able to correct individual predictions as inspected in diagnostic plots and most importantly it simulated realistic profiles that resembled the real data and canceled out the artifacts introduced by the elevated RUV, even in the case of the heavily misspecified model. Furthermore, a metric to quantify the extent of model misspecification was introduced based on the R2 between IRES and IRESML, following the rationale that the greater the extent of variability explained by the ML model, the higher the degree of model misspecification present in the original model.">

Despite their significance, current count-data models do not leverage this structured information. In particular, the widely used Poisson log-normal (PLN) model, known for its ability to model interactions between entities from count data, lacks the possibility to incorporate such hierarchical tree structures, limiting its applicability in domains characterized by such complexities. To address this matter, we introduce the PLN-Tree model as an extension of the PLN model, specifically designed for modeling hierarchical count data. By integrating structured variational inference techniques, we propose an adapted training procedure and establish identifiability results, enhancisng both theoretical foundations and practical interpretability. Additionally, we extend our framework to classification tasks as a preprocessing pipeline, showcasing its versatility. Experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as real-world microbiome data demonstrate the superior performance of the PLN-Tree model in capturing hierarchical dependencies and providing valuable insights into complex data structures, showing the practical interest of knowledge graphs like the taxonomy in ecosystems modeling.">

Subsequently, a second Long Short-Term Memory network is employed to detect and annotate disease progression events within the forecasted blood work time series. We show that these annotations enable the prediction of progression events with significant reliability (AUROC$~=~0.88~\pm~0.01$), up to 12 months in advance (AUROC($t+12~$mos)$~=0.65~\pm~0.01$). Our system is designed in a modular fashion, featuring separate entities for forecasting and progression event annotation. This structure not only enhances interpretability but also facilitates the integration of additional modules to perform subsequent operations on the generated outputs. Our approach utilizes a minimal set of routine blood work measurements, which avoids the need for expensive or resource-intensive tests and ensures accessibility of the system in clinical routine. This capability allows for individualized risk assessment and making informed treatment decisions tailored to a patient's unique disease kinetics.

        <tr id="Models have always been central to inferring molecular evolution and to reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Their use typically involves the development of a mechanistic framework reflecting our understanding of the underlying biological processes, such as nucleotide substitu- tions, and the estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. However, deriving and optimizing the likelihood of the data is not always possible under complex evolutionary scenarios or even tractable for large datasets, often leading to unrealistic simplifying assumptions in the fitted models. To overcome this issue, we coupled stochastic simulations of genome evolution with a new supervised deep learning model to infer key parameters of molecular evolution. Our model is designed to directly analyze multiple sequence alignments and estimate per-site evolutionary rates and divergence, without requiring a known phylogenetic tree. The accuracy of our predictions matched that of likelihood-based phylogenetic inference, when rate heterogeneity followed a simple gamma distribution, but it strongly exceeded it under more complex patterns of rate variation, such as codon models. Our approach is highly scalable and can be efficiently applied to genomic data, as we showed on a dataset of 26 million nucleotides from the clownfish clade. Our simulations also showed that the integration of per-site rates obtained by deep learning within a Bayesian framework led to significantly more accu- rate phylogenetic inference, particularly with respect to the estimated branch lengths. We thus propose that future advancements in phylogenetic analysis will benefit from a semi-supervised learning approach that combines deep-learning estimation of substitution rates, which allows for more flexible models of rate variation, and probabilistic inference of the phylogenetic tree, which guarantees interpretability and a rigorous assessment of statistical support.">

        <tr id="Identification of critical nodes is a prominent topic in the study of complex networks. Numerous methods have been proposed, yet most exhibit inherent limitations. Traditional approaches primarily analyze specific structural features of the network; however, node influence is typically the result of a combination of multiple factors. Machine learning-based methods struggle to effectively represent the complex characteristics of network structures through suitable embedding techniques and require substantial data for training, rendering them prohibitively costly for large-scale networks. To address these challenges, this paper presents an active learning model based on GraphSAGE and Transformer, named GNNTAL. This model is initially pre-trained on random or synthetic networks and subsequently fine-tuned on real-world networks by selecting a few representative nodes using K-Means clustering and uncertainty sampling. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it significantly reduces training costs; (2) it simultaneously incorporates both local and global features. A series of comparative experiments conducted on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that GNNTAL achieves superior performance. Additionally, this paper proposes an influence maximization method based on the predictions of the GNNTAL model, which achieves optimal performance without the need for complex computations. Finally, the paper analyses certain limitations of the GNNTAL model and suggests potential solutions.">

While FluxRGNN has been shown to successfully predict key migration patterns, its spatial resolution is constrained by the typically sparse observations obtained from weather radars. Additionally, its trainable components lack explicit incentives to adequately predict take-off and landing events. Both aspects limit our ability to interpret model results ecologically. To address this, we propose two major modifications that allow for more detailed predictions on any desired tessellation while providing control over the interpretability of model components. In experiments on the U.S. weather radar network, the enhanced model effectively leverages the underlying movement model, resulting in strong extrapolation capabilities to unobserved locations.">

The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods. By analysing three synthetic examples of varying complexity, we evaluate the validity and efficiency of ensembles, variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as epistemic UQ methods for UDEs.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models in ecology and epidemiology must be consistent with observed data in order to generate reliable knowledge and evidence-based policy. Metapopulation systems, which consist of a network of connected sub-populations, pose technical challenges in statistical inference owing to nonlinear, stochastic interactions. Numerical difficulties encountered in conducting inference can obstruct the core scientific questions concerning the link between the mathematical models and the data. Recently, an algorithm has been proposed that enables computationally tractable likelihood-based inference for high-dimensional partially observed stochastic dynamic models of metapopulation systems. We use this algorithm to build a statistically principled data analysis workflow for metapopulation systems. Via a case study of COVID-19, we show how this workflow addresses the limitations of previous approaches. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a situation where mathematical models and their policy implications are widely visible, and we revisit an influential metapopulation model used to inform basic epidemiological understanding early in the pandemic. Our methods support self-critical data analysis, enabling us to identify and address model weaknesses, leading to a new model with substantially improved statistical fit and parameter identifiability. Our results suggest that the lockdown initiated on 23 January 2020 in China was more effective than previously thought.">

This presents an unprecedented opportunity to unravel how the processes of DNA and RNA regulation direct cell fate determination and disease response. Most methods designed for analyzing large-scale perturbation data focus on the observational outcomes, e.g., expression; however, many potential transcriptional mechanisms, such as transcriptional bursting or splicing dynamics, can underlie these complex and noisy observations. In this analysis, we demonstrate how a stochastic biophysical modeling approach to interpreting high-throughout perturbation data enables deeper investigation of the ‘how’ behind such molecular measurements. Our approach takes advantage of modalities already present in data produced with current technologies, such as nascent and mature mRNA measurements, to illuminate transcriptional dynamics induced by perturbation, predict kinetic behaviors in new perturbation settings, and uncover novel populations of cells with distinct kinetic responses to perturbation.">

        <tr id="In the context of transcriptional dynamics modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the RNA level in a single cell is controlled by specific RNA kinetics parameters, which include transcription rate, splicing rate, and degradation rate. Investigating these single-cell RNA kinetics rates is pivotal for understanding RNA metabolism and the heterogeneity of complex tissues. Although metabolic labeling is an effective method to estimate these kinetics rates experimentally, it is not suitable for current large-scale conventional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Moreover, existing methods for scRNA-seq often either neglect certain specific kinetics parameters or use inappropriate ways to fit the parameters. To address these issues, we introduce scRNAkinetics, a parallelized method that fits the kinetics parameters of the ODE for each cell using pseudo-time derived from various biological priors (e.g. cell lineage tree and differentiation potential). This approach allows for the estimation of the relative kinetics of each cell and gene in a scRNA-seq dataset. Validated on simulated datasets, scRNAkinetics can accurately infer the kinetics rates of transcription boosting, multi-branch, and time-dependent RNA degradation systems. Nevertheless, the inferred kinetics trends are concordant with previous studies on metabolic labeling and conventional scRNA-seq datasets. Furthermore, we show that scRNAkinetics can provide valuable insights into different regulatory schemes and validate the coupling between transcription and splicing in RNA metabolism. The open-source implementation of scRNAkinetics is available at https://github.com/poseidonchan/scRNAkinetics.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
To use modern machine learning approaches to enhance and automate the feature extraction from the longitudinal circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) data and to improve the prediction of survival and disease progression, risk stratification, and treatment strategies for patients with 1L non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Using IMpower150 trial data on patients with untreated metastatic NSCLC treated with atezolizumab and chemotherapies, we developed a machine learning algorithm to extract predictive features from ctDNA kinetics, improving survival and progression prediction. We analyzed kinetic data from 17 ctDNA summary markers, including cell-free DNA concentration, allele frequency, tumor molecules in plasma, and mutation counts.


RESULTS
Three hundred and ninety-eight patients with ctDNA data (206 in training and 192 in validation) were analyzed. Our models outperformed existing workflow using conventional temporal ctDNA features, raising overall survival (OS) concordance index to 0.72 and 0.71 from 0.67 and 0.63 for C3D1 and C4D1, respectively, and substantially improving progression-free survival (PFS) to approximately 0.65 from the previous 0.54-0.58, a 12%-20% increase. Additionally, they enhanced risk stratification for patients with NSCLC, achieving clear OS and PFS separation. Distinct patterns of ctDNA kinetic characteristics (eg, baseline ctDNA markers, depth of ctDNA responses, and timing of ctDNA clearance, etc) were revealed across the risk groups. Rapid and complete ctDNA clearance appears essential for long-term clinical benefit.


CONCLUSION
Our machine learning approach offers a novel tool for analyzing ctDNA kinetics, extracting critical features from longitudinal data, improving our understanding of the link between ctDNA kinetics and progression/mortality risks, and optimizing personalized immunotherapies for 1L NSCLC.">

        <tr id="Machine learning algorithms identify patterns that would otherwise be difficult to observe in high-dimensional molecular and clinical data. For this reason, machine learning has the potential to have a profound impact on clinical decision making and drug target discovery. Nevertheless, there remain considerable technical challenges in adapting these tools for clinical use. These challenges include clinical feature engineering, model selection, and defining optimal strategies for model training. For cancer care, RNA sequencing of patient tumor biopsies has already proven to be a powerful molecular assay to characterize tumor-intrinsic and -extrinsic phenotypes influencing therapeutic response. To improve the predictive performance of RNA-sequencing data, we developed the tauX machine learning framework to refine gene expression features and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms. The tauX framework uses aggregated ratios of positively and negatively associated predictive genes to simplify the prediction task. We showed a significant improvement in predictive performance using a large database of synthetic gene expression profiles. We also show how the tauX framework can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of response and resistance to checkpoint blockade therapy using data from the Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C) Lung Response Cohort and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The tauX strategy achieved superior predictive performance compared to models built upon established feature engineering strategies or widely used cancer gene expression signatures.

        <tr id="The study of effective connectivity (EC) is essential in understanding how the brain integrates and responds to various sensory inputs. Model-driven estimation of EC is a powerful approach that requires estimating global and local parameters of a generative model of neural activity. Insights gathered through this process can be used in various applications, such as studying neurodevelopmental disorders. However, accurately determining EC through generative models remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of brain dynamics and the inherent noise in neural recordings, e.g., in electroencephalography (EEG). Current model-driven methods to study EC are computationally complex and cannot scale to all brain regions as required by whole-brain analyses. To facilitate EC assessment, an inference algorithm must exhibit reliable prediction of parameters in the presence of noise. Further, the relationship between the model parameters and the neural recordings must be learnable. To progress toward these objectives, we benchmarked the performance of a Bi-LSTM model for parameter inference from the Jansen-Rit neural mass model (JR-NMM) simulated EEG under various noise conditions. Additionally, our study explores how the JR-NMM reacts to changes in key biological parameters (i.e., sensitivity analysis) like synaptic gains and time constants, a crucial step in understanding the connection between neural mechanisms and observed brain activity. Our results indicate that we can predict the local JR-NMM parameters from EEG, supporting the feasibility of our deep-learning-based inference approach. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to estimate local and global parameters from real EEG in clinically relevant applications.">

        <tr id="This review explores the concept of synergy in pharmacology, emphasizing its importance in optimizing treatment outcomes through the combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Synergy, defined as an effect greater than the expected additive effect elicited by individual agents according to specific predictive models, offers a promising approach to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse events. The historical evolution of synergy research, from ancient civilizations to modern pharmacology, highlights the ongoing quest to understand and harness synergistic interactions. Key concepts such as concentration-response curves, additive effects, and predictive models are discussed in detail, emphasizing the need for accurate assessment methods throughout translational drug development. While various mathematical models exist for synergy analysis, selecting the appropriate model and software tools remains a challenge, necessitating careful consideration of experimental design and data interpretation. Furthermore, this review addresses practical considerations in synergy assessment, including preclinical and clinical approaches, mechanism of action, and statistical analysis. Optimizing synergy requires attention to concentration/dose ratios, target site localization, and timing of drug administration, ensuring that the benefits of combination therapy detected at bench-side are translatable into clinical practice. Overall, the review advocates for a systematic approach to synergy assessment, incorporating robust statistical analysis, effective and simplified predictive models, and collaborative efforts across pivotal sectors such as academic institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies. By overcoming critical challenges and maximizing therapeutic potential, effective synergy assessment in drug development holds promise for advancing patient care. Significance Statement Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action for synergistic interactions optimizes treatment efficacy and safety. Accurate interpretation of synergy requires the identification of the expected additive effect. Despite innovative models to predict the additive effect, consensus in drug interaction research is lacking, hindering the bench-to-bedside development of combination therapies. Collaboration among science, industry, and regulation is crucial for advancing combination therapy development, ensuring rigorous application of predictive models in clinical settings.">

The current gold standard for inferring parameter distributions across cell populations is the Global Two Stage (GTS) approach for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) models. However, this method is computationally intensive, as it makes repeated use of non-convex optimization that in turn requires numerical integration of the underlying system. Here, we propose the Gradient Matching GTS (GMGTS) method as an efficient alternative to GTS. Gradient matching offers an integration-free approach to parameter estimation that is particularly powerful for dynamical systems that are linear in the unknown parameters, such as biochemical networks modeled by mass action kinetics. Here, we harness the power of gradient matching by integrating it into the GTS framework. To this end, we significantly expand the capabilities of gradient matching via uncertainty propagation calculations and the development of an iterative estimation scheme for partially observed systems. Through comparisons of GMGTS with GTS in different inference setups, we demonstrate that our method provides a significant computational advantage, thereby facilitating the use of complex NLME models in systems biology applications.">

Addressing it is critical in order to improve prevention, early detection and survival rates. Here, I briefly summarize some key emerging theoretical and computational challenges as well as recent computational advances that promise to help realize the goals of cancer-risk prediction. The focus is on computational strategies based on single-cell data, in particular on bottom-up network modeling approaches that aim to estimate cancer stemness and dedifferentiation at single-cell resolution from a systems-biological perspective. I will describe two promising methods, a tissue and cell-lineage independent one based on the concept of diffusion network entropy, and a tissue and cell-lineage specific one that uses transcription factor regulons. Application of these tools to single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-seq data from stages prior to invasive cancer reveal that they can successfully delineate the heterogeneous inter-cellular cancer-risk landscape, identifying those cells that are more likely to turn cancerous. Bottom-up systems biological modeling of single-cell omic data is a novel computational analysis paradigm that promises to facilitate the development of preventive, early detection and cancer-risk prediction strategies.">

        <tr id="Graphs serve as generic tools to encode the underlying relational structure of data. Often this graph is not given, and so the task of inferring it from nodal observations becomes important. Traditional approaches formulate a convex inverse problem with a smoothness promoting objective and rely on iterative methods to obtain a solution. In supervised settings where graph labels are available, one can unroll and truncate these iterations into a deep network that is trained end-to-end. Such a network is parameter efficient and inherits inductive bias from the optimization formulation, an appealing aspect for data constrained settings in, e.g., medicine, finance, and the natural sciences. But typically such settings care equally about uncertainty over edge predictions, not just point estimates. Here we introduce novel iterations with independently interpretable parameters, i.e., parameters whose values - independent of other parameters' settings - proportionally influence characteristics of the estimated graph, such as edge sparsity. After unrolling these iterations, prior knowledge over such graph characteristics shape prior distributions over these independently interpretable network parameters to yield a Bayesian neural network (BNN) capable of graph structure learning (GSL) from smooth signal observations. Fast execution and parameter efficiency allow for high-fidelity posterior approximation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and thus uncertainty quantification on edge predictions. Synthetic and real data experiments corroborate this model's ability to provide well-calibrated estimates of uncertainty, in test cases that include unveiling economic sector modular structure from S$\&$P$500$ data and recovering pairwise digit similarities from MNIST images. Overall, this framework enables GSL in modest-scale applications where uncertainty on the data structure is paramount.">

        <tr id="Reconstructing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data holds great promise for unraveling cellular fate development and heterogeneity. While numerous machine-learning methods have been proposed to infer GRNs from scRNA-seq gene expression data, many of them operate solely in a statistical or black box manner, limiting their capacity for making causal inferences between genes. In this study, we introduce GRN inference with Accuracy and Causal Explanation (GRACE), a novel graph-based causal autoencoder framework that combines a structural causal model (SCM) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to enable GRN inference and gene causal reasoning from scRNA-seq data. By explicitly modeling causal relationships between genes, GRACE facilitates the learning of regulatory context and gene embeddings. With the learned gene signals, our model successfully decoding the causal structures and alleviates the accurate determination of multiple attributes of gene regulation that is important to determine the regulatory levels. Through extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRACE outperforms 14 state-of-the-art GRN inference methods, with the incorporation of causal mechanisms significantly enhancing the accuracy of GRN and gene causality inference. Furthermore, the application to human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples reveals cell type-specific regulators in monocyte phagocytosis and immune regulation, validated through network analysis and functional enrichment analysis.">

These equations are coupled with a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model of drug delivery, implementing a realistic delivery schedule. The model is carefully calibrated from the literature, focusing on BRAF-mutated melanoma treated with Dabrafenib as a case study. By means of long-time asymptotic analysis, global sensitivity analysis and numerical simulations, we explore the impact of cell migration from the primary to the metastatic site, physiological aspects of the tumour sites and drug dose on the development of drug resistance and treatment efficacy. Our findings provide a possible explanation for empirical evidence indicating that chemotherapy may foster metastatic spread and that metastatic sites may be less impacted by chemotherapy.">

        <tr id="It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.">

Through analyses of antigen- specific T cells and T cells related to lung cancer immunotherapy, we demonstrate MIST’s interpretability and flexibility. MIST easily and accurately resolves cell function and antigen-specificity by vectorizing and integrating transcriptome and TCR data of T cells. In addition, using MIST, we identified the heterogeneity of CXCL13+ subsets in lung cancer infiltrating CD8+ T cells and their association with immunotherapy, providing additional insights into the functional transition of CXCL13+ T cells related to anti-PD-1 therapy that were not reported in the original study.

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

        <tr id="The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex ecosystem of diverse cell types whose interactions govern tumor growth and clinical outcome. While the TME’s impact on immunotherapy has been extensively studied, its role in chemotherapy response remains less explored. To address this, we developed DECODEM (DEcoupling Cell-type-specific Outcomes using DEconvolution and Machine learning), a generic computational framework leveraging cellular deconvolution of bulk transcriptomics to associate the gene expression of individual cell types in the TME with clinical response. Employing DECODEM to analyze the gene expression of breast cancer (BC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we find that the gene expression of specific immune cells (myeloid, plasmablasts, B-cells) and stromal cells (endothelial, normal epithelial, CAFs) are highly predictive of chemotherapy response, going beyond that of the malignant cells. These findings are further tested and validated in a single-cell cohort of triple negative breast cancer. To investigate the possible role of immune cell-cell interactions (CCIs) in mediating chemotherapy response, we extended DECODEM to DECODEMi to identify such CCIs, validated in single-cell data. Our findings highlight the importance of active pre-treatment immune infiltration for chemotherapy success. The tools developed here are made publicly available and are applicable for studying the role of the TME in mediating response from readily available bulk tumor expression in a wide range of cancer treatments and indications.">

Predicting cancer drug response requires a comprehensive assessment of many mutations present across a tumor genome. While current drug response models generally use a binary mutated/unmutated indicator for each gene, not all mutations in a gene are equivalent.


RESULTS
Here, we construct and evaluate a series of predictive models based on leading methods for quantitative mutation scoring. Such methods include VEST4 and CADD, which score the impact of a mutation on gene function, and CHASMplus, which scores the likelihood a mutation drives cancer. The resulting predictive models capture cellular responses to dabrafenib, which targets BRAF-V600 mutations, whereas models based on binary mutation status do not. Performance improvements generalize to other drugs, extending genetic indications for PIK3CA, ERBB2, EGFR, PARP1, and ABL1 inhibitors. Introducing quantitative mutation features in drug response models increases performance and mechanistic understanding.

        <tr id="Identifying the association and corresponding types of miRNAs and diseases is crucial for studying the molecular mechanisms of disease-related miRNAs. Compared to traditional biological experiments, computational models can not only save time and reduce costs, but also discover potential associations on a large scale. Although some computational models based on tensor decomposition have been proposed, these models usually require manual specification of numerous hyperparameters, leading to a decrease in computational efficiency and generalization ability. Additionally, these linear models struggle to analyze complex, higher-order nonlinear relationships. Based on this, we propose a novel framework, KBLTDARD, to identify potential multiple types of miRNA-disease associations. Firstly, KBLTDARD extracts information from biological networks and high-order association network, and then fuses them to obtain more precise similarities of miRNAs (diseases). Secondly, we combine logistic tensor decomposition and Bayesian methods to achieve automatic hyperparameter search by introducing sparse-induced priors of multiple latent variables, and incorporate auxiliary information to improve prediction capabilities. Finally, an efficient deterministic Bayesian inference algorithm is developed to ensure computational efficiency. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that KBLTDARD has better Top-1 precision, Top-1 recall, and Top-1 F1 for new type predictions, and higher AUPR, AUC, and F1 values for new triplet predictions, compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the efficiency of KBLTDARD in predicting multiple types of miRNA-disease associations.">

While deep learning is increasingly used, it is difficult to generalize due to variability at the level of cells, neighborhoods, and niches in health and disease. To address this, we developed TACIT, an unsupervised algorithm for cell annotation using predefined signatures that operates without training data. TACIT uses unbiased thresholding to distinguish positive cells from background, focusing on relevant markers to identify ambiguous cells in multiomic assays. Using five datasets (5,000,000-cells; 51-cell types) from three niches (brain, intestine, gland), TACIT outperformed existing unsupervised methods in accuracy and scalability. Integrating TACIT-identified cell types with a novel Shiny app revealed new phenotypes in two inflammatory gland diseases. Finally, using combined spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, we discovered under- and overrepresented immune cell types and states in regions of interest, suggesting multimodality is essential for translating spatial biology to clinical applications.">

Many approaches have been developed to infer the accumulation pathways by which features (for example, mutations) are acquired over time. However, most of these approaches do not support reversibility: the loss of a feature once it has been acquired (for example, the clearing of a mutation from a tumour or population). Here, we demonstrate how the well-established Mk model from evolutionary biology, embedded on a hypercubic transition graph, can be used to infer the dynamics of accumulation processes, including the possibility of reversible transitions, from data which may be uncertain and cross-sectional, longitudinal, or phylogenetically / phylogenomically embedded. Positive and negative interactions between arbitrary sets of features (not limited to pairwise interactions) are supported. We demonstrate this approach with synthetic datasets and real data on bacterial drug resistance and cancer progression. While this implementation is limited in the number of features that can be considered, we discuss how this limitation may be relaxed to deal with larger systems.">

        <tr id="Abstract Background Glioblastoma (GBM) remains associated with a dismal prognoses despite standard therapies. While population-level survival statistics are established, generating individualized prognosis remains challenging. We aim to develop machine learning (ML) models that generate personalized survival predictions for GBM patients to enhance prognostication. Methods Adult patients with histologically confirmed IDH-wildtype GBM from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) were analyzed. ML models were developed with TabPFN, TabNet, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest algorithms to predict mortality at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postdiagnosis. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to enhance the interpretability of the models. Models were primarily evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) values, and the top-performing models indicated by the highest AUROCs for each outcome were deployed in a web application that was created for individualized predictions. Results A total of 7537 patients were retrieved from the NCDB. Performance evaluation revealed the top-performing models for each outcome were built using the TabPFN algorithm. The TabPFN models yielded mean AUROCs of 0.836, 0.78, 0.732, and 0.724 in predicting 6, 12, 18, and 24 month mortality, respectively. Conclusions This study establishes ML models tailored to individual patients to enhance GBM prognostication. Future work should focus on external validation and dynamic updating as new data emerge.">

Due to their complexity, interpretable surrogate models can only be built for local explanations (e.g., a single instance). However, accomplishing this requires generating a dataset in the neighborhood of the input, which must maintain syntactic similarity to the original data while introducing semantic variability in the model's predictions. This task is challenging due to the complex sequence-to-function relationship of DNA. We propose using Genetic Programming to generate datasets by evolving perturbations in sequences that contribute to their semantic diversity. Our custom, domain-guided individual representation effectively constrains syntactic similarity, and we provide two alternative fitness functions that promote diversity with no computational effort. Applied to the RNA splicing domain, our approach quickly achieves good diversity and significantly outperforms a random baseline in exploring the search space, as shown by our proof-of-concept, short RNA sequence. Furthermore, we assess its generalizability and demonstrate scalability to larger sequences, resulting in a ~30% improvement over the baseline.">

These models have shown promise in various cell biology applications, including cell type annotation, perturbation inference, and cell state embedding, etc. However, their clinical utility, particularly in cancer diagnosis and prognosis, remains an open question. We introduce the GeneBag model, a novel CFM that represents a cell as “a bag of unordered genes” with continuous expression values and a full-length gene list. Pre-trained on single-cell data and fine-tuned on bulk RNA-seq datasets, GeneBag achieves superior performance across cancer diagnosis and prognosis scenarios. In a zero-shot learning setting, GeneBag can classify cancer and non-cancer tissues with approximately 96.2% accuracy. With fine-tuning, it can annotate 40 different types of cancers and corresponding normal biopsies with an overall accuracy of ∼97.2%. It notably excels in classifying challenging cancers such as bladder (93%) and stomach (90%). Furthermore, GeneBag is capable of cancer staging with 68.5% accuracy and 5-year survival prediction with an AUC of ∼80.4%. This study marks the first to demonstrate the potential of CFMs in RNA-based cancer diagnostics and prognostics, indicating a promising avenue for AI-assisted molecular diagnosis.">

Integrating this data to obtain a full understanding of pathology remains challenging. We introduce a new method called Deep Latent Variable Path Modelling (DLVPM), which combines the representational power of deep learning with the capacity of path modelling to identify relationships between interacting elements in a complex system. To evaluate the capabilities of DLVPM, we initially trained a foundational model to map dependencies between SNV, Methylation, miRNA-Seq, RNA-Seq and Histological data using Breast Cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). This method exhibited superior performance in mapping associations between data types compared to classical path modelling. We additionally performed successful applications of the model to: stratify single-cell data, identify synthetic lethal interactions using CRISPR-Cas9 screens derived from cell-lines, and detect histologic-transcriptional associations using spatial transcriptomic data. Results from each of these data types can then be understood with reference to the same holistic model of illness.">

        <tr id="8614 Background: Advanced lung adenocarcinoma (aLUAD) is divided into multiple molecularly defined subsets, each with specific biological characteristics and responses to targeted therapy. Consequently, conducting practice-changing and cost-effective randomized trials is challenging. In silico clinical trials, utilizing mechanistic computational models, offer a potential solution, yet their ability to predict clinical trial results has not been proven. Methods: We updated a previously published version of the computational mechanistic model of EGFR-mutated aLUAD, notably by incorporating metastases. Disease model was integrated with physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models of cisplatin, pemetrexed, and osimertinib, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the disease's dynamics. These models are founded on causal connections between biological entities and phenomena, establishing a link between the specific biological behaviors of EGFR-mutated aLUAD and the evolution of tumor size and progression over time. We have independently and prospectively simulated the outcomes of the FLAURA2 and MARIPOSA randomized trials dedicated to EGFR-mutated aLUAD. This was achieved by replicating the experimental protocols and generating cohorts of virtual twins of patients using publicly available data. Results: In silico results were released before the actual outcomes of the FLAURA2 and MARIPOSA trials were publicly available. The simulations yielded predictions with overlapping confidence intervals, similar hazard ratios, median survivals, and shapes of curves compared to the actual trial data. Bootstrapped weighted log-rank tests were used to compare the simulated and observed Kaplan-Meier curves for the two arms of FLAURA2 and for the osimertinib arm of MARIPOSA. Between 94 and 98% of the tests were statistically non-significant (α=0.05), confirming the accuracy of the predictions. Conclusions: This first-of-its-kind prediction of clinical trial outcomes demonstrates that in silico trials, when based on robust mechanistic models, can be a reliable tool for enhancing the design of actual trials, particularly for EGFR-mutated aLUAD. They offer a promising avenue for overcoming the challenges of comparator arms in single-arm trials and may serve as a new standard for formulating statistical hypotheses in future studies.">

        <tr id="We present the first use of machine learning tools to predict multistationarity of reaction networks. Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) are the mathematical formulation of how the quantities associated to a set of species (molecules, proteins, cells, or animals) vary as time passes with respect to their interactions with each other. Their mathematics does not describe just chemical reactions but many other areas of the life sciences such as ecology, epidemiology, and population dynamics. We say a CRN is at a steady state when the concentration (or number) of species do not vary anymore. Some CRNs do not attain a steady state while some others may have more than one possible steady state. The CRNs in the later group are called multistationary. Multistationarity is an important property, e.g. switch-like behaviour in cells needs multistationarity to occur. Existing algorithms to detect whether a CRN is multistationary or not are either extremely expensive or restricted in the type of CRNs they can be used on, motivating a new machine learning approach. We address the problem of representing variable-length CRN data to machine learning models by developing a new graph representation of CRNs for use with graph learning algorithms. We contribute a large dataset of labelled fully open CRNs whose production necessitated the development of new CRN theory. Then we present experimental results on the training and testing of a graph attention network model on this dataset, showing excellent levels of performance. We finish by testing the model predictions on validation data produced independently, demonstrating generalisability of the model to different types of CRN.">

        <tr id="Abstract Accurate understanding of the biological functions of enzymes is vital for various tasks in both pathologies and industrial biotechnology. However, the existing methods are usually not fast enough and lack explanations on the prediction results, which severely limits their real-world applications. Following our previous work, DEEPre, we propose a new interpretable and fast version (ifDEEPre) by designing novel self-guided attention and incorporating biological knowledge learned via large protein language models to accurately predict the commission numbers of enzymes and confirm their functions. Novel self-guided attention is designed to optimize the unique contributions of representations, automatically detecting key protein motifs to provide meaningful interpretations. Representations learned from raw protein sequences are strictly screened to improve the running speed of the framework, 50 times faster than DEEPre while requiring 12.89 times smaller storage space. Large language modules are incorporated to learn physical properties from hundreds of millions of proteins, extending biological knowledge of the whole network. Extensive experiments indicate that ifDEEPre outperforms all the current methods, achieving more than 14.22% larger F1-score on the NEW dataset. Furthermore, the trained ifDEEPre models accurately capture multi-level protein biological patterns and infer evolutionary trends of enzymes by taking only raw sequences without label information. Meanwhile, ifDEEPre predicts the evolutionary relationships between different yeast sub-species, which are highly consistent with the ground truth. Case studies indicate that ifDEEPre can detect key amino acid motifs, which have important implications for designing novel enzymes. A web server running ifDEEPre is available at https://proj.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/aihlab/ifdeepre/ to provide convenient services to the public.

        <tr id="RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become a key technology in precision medicine, especially for cancer prognosis. However, the high dimensionality of such data may restrict classic statistical methods, thus raising the need to learn dense representations from them. Transformers models have exhibited capacities in providing representations for long sequences and thus are well suited for transcriptomics data. In this paper, we develop a pre-trained transformer-based language model through self-supervised learning using bulk RNA-seq from both non-cancer and cancer tissues, following BERT’s masking method. By probing learned embeddings from the model or using parameter-efficient fine-tuning, we then build downstream models for cancer type classification and survival time prediction. Leveraging the TCGA dataset, we demonstrate the performance of our method, BulkRNABert, on both tasks, with significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods in the pan-cancer setting for classification and survival analysis. We also show the transfer-learning capabilities of the model in the survival analysis setting on unseen cohorts. Code available at https://github.com/instadeepai/multiomics-open-research">

        <tr id="Many causal systems such as biological processes in cells can only be observed indirectly via measurements, such as gene expression. Causal representation learning -- the task of correctly mapping low-level observations to latent causal variables -- could advance scientific understanding by enabling inference of latent variables such as pathway activation. In this paper, we develop methods for inferring latent variables from multiple related datasets (environments) and tasks. As a running example, we consider the task of predicting a phenotype from gene expression, where we often collect data from multiple cell types or organisms that are related in known ways. The key insight is that the mapping from latent variables driven by gene expression to the phenotype of interest changes sparsely across closely related environments. To model sparse changes, we introduce Tree-Based Regularization (TBR), an objective that minimizes both prediction error and regularizes closely related environments to learn similar predictors. We prove that under assumptions about the degree of sparse changes, TBR identifies the true latent variables up to some simple transformations. We evaluate the theory empirically with both simulations and ground-truth gene expression data. We find that TBR recovers the latent causal variables better than related methods across these settings, even under settings that violate some assumptions of the theory.">

        <tr id="Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, or to accurately predict the effects of cell-specific optogenetic perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the “cell-type dynamical systems” (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for E and I cells, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that both E and I latents could be used to decode the animal’s choice, showing that choice-related information is not restricted to a single cell class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the causal effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model—which lacks the ability to capture cell-specific perturbations—did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.">

However, its effectiveness critically depends on proper hyperparameter setting, a step that is not always performed systematically in the development of ML models. In this study, we aimed to highlight the impact that this process has on the final performance of ML models through a real-world case study by predicting the five-year recurrence of breast cancer patients. We compared the performance of five ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boost, and Deep Neural Network) before and after optimizing their hyperparameters. Simpler algorithms showed better performance using the default hyperparameters. However, after the optimization process, the more complex algorithms demonstrated superior performance. The AUCs obtained before and after adjustment were 0.7 vs. 0.84 for XGB, 0.64 vs. 0.75 for DNN, 0.7 vs. 0.8 for GB, 0.62 vs. 0.7 for DT, and 0.77 vs. 0.72 for LR. The results underscore the critical importance of hyperparameter selection in the development of ML algorithms for the prediction of cancer recurrence. Neglecting this step can undermine the potential of more powerful algorithms and lead to the choice of suboptimal models.">

Leveraging popular machine learning models, such as Adaptive Boosting, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting, along with fusion models like Voting, Stacking, and Blending, our approach significantly improves prognostic accuracy as shown in our experiments.

Through modal segmentation and multimodal fusion applied to raw data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, we enhance the precision of renal cell carcinoma prognosis. Our proposed model provides an interpretable analysis of model predictions, highlighting key variables influencing classification and regression decisions in the two-stage renal cell carcinoma prognosis framework.

        <tr id="Machine learning is increasingly employed in engineering, with one of its primary applications being the construction of surrogate models to replace computationally expensive physical models for analysis and design, especially control co-design which integrates physical and control system design. In cases where generating labels for training through physical models is computationally intensive, label-free machine learning offers a viable alternative. However, surrogate models built from label-free machine learning typically have prediction errors, which can be characterized and quantified through epistemic uncertainty, representing model-form uncertainty. Moreover, when these surrogate models are used in optimization design for real-world applications, inherent random variables introduce aleatory uncertainty. This study introduces a robust design optimization method that addresses the intertwined epistemic and aleatory uncertainty. By optimizing both the average product performance and reducing uncertainty stemming from the coupled uncertainty, the method achieves improved robustness. A four-bar linkage mechanism design serves as a demonstration of this approach. The surrogate model for the design is constructed using label-free neural network, accommodating a system of physical equations. The error of the surrogate model is assessed through Gaussian Process regression, using existing training points and derivatives of the physical equations at these points. The design of the four-bar linkage aims to minimize both its average motion error and the variability of the error attributed to coupled uncertainty.">

 Connectome-based models, also known as Virtual Brain Models (VBMs), have been well established in network neuroscience to investigate pathophysiological causes underlying a large range of brain diseases. The integration of an individual's brain imaging data in VBMs has improved patient-specific predictivity, although Bayesian estimation of spatially distributed parameters remains challenging even with state-of-the-art Monte Carlo sampling. VBMs imply latent nonlinear state space models driven by noise and network input, necessitating advanced probabilistic machine learning techniques for widely applicable Bayesian estimation. Here we present Simulation-based Inference on Virtual Brain Models (SBI-VBMs), and demonstrate that training deep neural networks on both spatio-temporal and functional features allows for accurate estimation of generative parameters in brain disorders. The systematic use of brain stimulation provides an effective remedy for the non-identifiability issue in estimating the degradation limited to smaller subset of connections. By prioritizing model structure over data, we show that the hierarchical structure in SBI-VBMs renders the inference more effective, precise and biologically plausible. This approach could broadly advance precision medicine by enabling fast and reliable prediction of patient-specific brain disorders.">

        <tr id="Intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity is nowadays understood to play a critical role in disease progression and treatment failure. Accordingly, there has been increasing interest in the development of mathematical models capable of capturing its role in cancer cell adaptation. This can be systematically achieved by means of models comprising phenotype-structured nonlocal partial differential equations, tracking the evolution of the phenotypic density distribution of the cell population, which may be compared to gene and protein expression distributions obtained experimentally. Nevertheless, given the high analytical and computational cost of solving these models, much is to be gained from reducing them to systems of ordinary differential equations for the moments of the distribution. We propose a generalised method of model-reduction, relying on the use of a moment generating function, Taylor series expansion and truncation closure, to reduce a nonlocal reaction-advection-diffusion equation, with general phenotypic drift and proliferation rate functions, to a system of moment equations up to arbitrary order. Our method extends previous results in the literature, which we address via two examples, by removing any \textit{a priori} assumption on the shape of the distribution, and provides a flexible framework for mathematical modellers to account for the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer adaptive dynamics, in a simpler mathematical framework.">

This introduces several advantages previously unrealized by state-of-the-art approaches in NE: (1) We can draw inspiration from how nature, thanks to millions of years of evolution, efficiently encodes protein interactions in the DNA to translate our APN to silicon DNA. This helps bridge the gap between syntax and semantics observed in current NE approaches. (2) We can learn from how nature builds networks in our genes, allowing us to design new and smarter networks through EA evolution. (3) We can perform EA crossover/mutation operations and evolution steps, replicating the operations observed in nature directly on the genotype of networks, thus exploring and exploiting the phenotypic space, such that we avoid getting trapped in sub-optimal solutions. (4) Our novel definition of APN opens new ways to leverage our knowledge about different living things and processes from biology. (5) Using biologically inspired encodings, we can model more complex demographic and ecological relationships (e.g., virus-host or predator-prey interactions), allowing us to optimise for multiple, often conflicting objectives.">

The recent publications of RoseTTAFold All-Atom and AlphaFold 3 have shown high-quality results on predicting the structures of proteins interacting with small-molecules, other proteins and nucleic-acids. Despite these advanced capabilities and broad potential, the current study presents critical findings that question these models’ adherence to fundamental physical principles and its susceptibility to overfitting specific protein families. Through adversarial examples based on established physical, chemical, and biological principles, we demonstrate notable discrepancies in protein-ligand structural predictions when subjected to biologically plausible perturbations. These discrepancies reveal a significant divergence from expected physical behaviors, indicating potential overfitting to particular data subsets within its training corpus. Our findings underscore the models’ limitations in generalizing effectively across diverse biological structures and highlight the necessity of integrating robust physical and chemical priors in the development of such predictive tools. The results advocate a measured reliance on deep-learning-based models for critical applications in drug discovery and protein engineering, where a deep understanding of the underlying physical and chemical properties is crucial.">

However, the extensive size of these models, coupled with the limited interpretative capabilities of current fine-tuning methods, impedes the integration of pre-trained models into the drug discovery process. This paper pushes the boundaries of pre-trained models in drug discovery by designing a novel fine-tuning paradigm known as the Head Feature Parallel Adapter (HFPA), which is highly interpretable, high-performing, and has fewer parameters than other widely used methods. Specifically, this approach enables the model to consider diverse information across representation subspaces concurrently by strategically using Adapters, which can operate directly within the model's feature space. Our tactic freezes the backbone model and forces various small-size Adapters' corresponding subspaces to focus on exploring different atomic and chemical bond knowledge, thus maintaining a small number of trainable parameters and enhancing the interpretability of the model. Moreover, we furnish a comprehensive interpretability analysis, imparting valuable insights into the chemical area. HFPA outperforms over seven physiology and toxicity tasks and achieves state-of-the-art results in three physical chemistry tasks. We also test ten additional molecular datasets, demonstrating the robustness and broad applicability of HFPA.">

A high accuracy (0.85+) was achieved in the classification of adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy for breast cancer patients. Furthermore, a confidence interval was formed from observational data on the quality of treatment from human oncologists to estimate the proportion of scenarios in which the model must outperform the original oncologist in its treatment prediction to be a better solution overall as 8.2% to 13.3%. Due to indeterminacy in the outcomes of cancer treatment decisions, future investigation, potentially a clinical trial, would be required to determine if this threshold was met by the models. Nevertheless, with 85% of U.S. cancer patients receiving treatment at local community facilities, these kinds of models could play an important part in expanding access to quality care with outcomes that lie, at minimum, close to a human oncologist.">

Currently, although machine learning algorithms have played a crucial role in scientific research with numerous successful cases, relatively few instances exist where AI assists researchers in uncovering the underlying physical mechanisms behind a certain phenomenon and subsequently using that mechanism to improve machine learning algorithms' efficiency. This article uses the investigation into the relationship between extreme Poisson's ratio values and the structure of amorphous networks as a case study to illustrate how machine learning methods can assist in revealing underlying physical mechanisms. Upon recognizing that the Poisson's ratio relies on the low-frequency vibrational modes of the dynamical matrix, we can then employ a convolutional neural network, trained on the dynamical matrix instead of traditional image recognition, to predict the Poisson's ratio of amorphous networks with a much higher efficiency. Through this example, we aim to showcase the role that artificial intelligence can play in revealing fundamental physical mechanisms, which subsequently improves the machine learning algorithms significantly.">

While conventional approaches to understanding these computations often focus on isolating the contributions of single neurons, here we argue that a deeper understanding requires considering emergent dynamics - dynamics that make the whole system"more than the sum of its parts". Specifically, we examine the relationship between prediction performance and emergence by leveraging recent quantitative metrics of emergence, derived from Partial Information Decomposition, and by modelling the prediction of environmental dynamics in a bio-inspired computational framework known as reservoir computing. Notably, we reveal a bidirectional coupling between prediction performance and emergence, which generalises across task environments and reservoir network topologies, and is recapitulated by three key results: 1) Optimising hyperparameters for performance enhances emergent dynamics, and vice versa; 2) Emergent dynamics represent a near sufficient criterion for prediction success in all task environments, and an almost necessary criterion in most environments; 3) Training reservoir computers on larger datasets results in stronger emergent dynamics, which contain task-relevant information crucial for performance. Overall, our study points to a pivotal role of emergence in facilitating environmental predictions in a bio-inspired computational architecture.">

Networks can be built to represent distinct conditions and compared to uncover graph-level differences—such as when comparing patterns of gene-gene interactions that change between biological states. Given the importance of the graph comparison problem, there is a clear and growing need for robust and scalable methods that can identify meaningful differences. We introduce node2vec2rank (n2v2r), a method for graph differential analysis that ranks nodes according to the disparities of their representations in joint latent embedding spaces. Improving upon previous bag-of-features approaches, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning and statistics to compare graphs in higher-order structures and in a data-driven manner. Formulated as a multi-layer spectral embedding algorithm, n2v2r is computationally efficient, incorporates stability as a key feature, and can provably identify the correct ranking of differences between graphs in an overall procedure that adheres to veridical data science principles. By better adapting to the data, node2vec2rank clearly outperformed the commonly used node degree in finding complex differences in simulated data. In the real-world applications of breast cancer subtype characterization, analysis of cell cycle in single-cell data, and searching for sex differences in lung adenocarcinoma, node2vec2rank found meaningful biological differences enabling the hypothesis generation for therapeutic candidates.

Key problems in genomics intrinsically involve multiple modalities, but it remains unclear how to adapt general-purpose sequence models to those cases. In this work we propose a multi-modal model that connects DNA, RNA, and proteins by leveraging information from different pre-trained modality-specific encoders. We demonstrate its capabilities by applying it to the largely unsolved problem of predicting how multiple RNA transcript isoforms originate from the same gene (i.e. same DNA sequence) and map to different transcription expression levels across various human tissues. We show that our model, dubbed IsoFormer, is able to accurately predict differential transcript expression, outperforming existing methods and leveraging the use of multiple modalities. Our framework also achieves efficient transfer knowledge from the encoders pre-training as well as in between modalities. We open-source our model, paving the way for new multi-modal gene expression approaches.">

In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered wildfire spreading model integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters, essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning approach leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, such as the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using data of the temporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional (plane surface) fire fronts that have been obtained from a high-fidelity simulator of the wildfire spreading model under consideration. The parameter learning results demonstrate the remarkable predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients in both the one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters in the presence of noisy data. The proposed framework is envisioned to be incorporated in a physics-informed digital twin for intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment.">

        <tr id="In silico methods evaluating the mutation effects of missense mutations are providing an important approach for understanding mutations in personal genomes and identifying disease-relevant biomarkers. However, existing methods, including deep learning methods, heavily rely on sequence-aware information, and do not fully leverage the potential of available 3D structural information. In addition, these methods may exhibit an inability to predict mutations in domains difficult to formulate sequence-based embeddings. In this study, we introduce a novel rationale-guided graph neural network AlphaGMut to evaluate mutation effects and to distinguish pathogenic mutations from neutral mutations. We compute the alpha shapes of protein structures to obtain atomic-resolution edge connectivities and map them to an accurate residue-level graph representation. We then compute structural-, topological-, biophysical-, and sequence properties of the mutation sites, which are assigned as node attributes in the graph. These node attributes could effectively guide the graph neural network to learn the difference between pathogenic and neutral mutations using k-hop message passing with a short training period. We demonstrate that AlphaGMut outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including DeepMind's AlphaMissense, in many performance metrics. In addition, AlphaGMut has the advantage of performing well in alignment-free settings, which provides broader prediction coverage and better generalization compared to current methods requiring deep sequence-aware information.">

        <tr id="The dynamics of biological systems, from proteins to cells to organisms, is complex and stochastic. To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

        <tr id="Abstract Motivation Complex diseases are often caused and characterized by misregulation of multiple biological pathways. Differential network analysis aims to detect significant rewiring of biological network structures under different conditions and has become an important tool for understanding the molecular etiology of disease progression and therapeutic response. With few exceptions, most existing differential network analysis tools perform differential tests on separately learned network structures that are computationally expensive and prone to collapse when grouped samples are limited or less consistent. Results We previously developed an accurate differential network analysis method—differential dependency networks (DDN), that enables joint learning of common and rewired network structures under different conditions. We now introduce the DDN3.0 tool that improves this framework with three new and highly efficient algorithms, namely, unbiased model estimation with a weighted error measure applicable to imbalance sample groups, multiple acceleration strategies to improve learning efficiency, and data-driven determination of proper hyperparameters. The comparative experimental results obtained from both realistic simulations and case studies show that DDN3.0 can help biologists more accurately identify, in a study-specific and often unknown conserved regulatory circuitry, a network of significantly rewired molecular players potentially responsible for phenotypic transitions. Availability and implementation The Python package of DDN3.0 is freely available at https://github.com/cbil-vt/DDN3. A user’s guide and a vignette are provided at https://ddn-30.readthedocs.io/.">

        <tr id="Causal models provide rich descriptions of complex systems as sets of mechanisms by which each variable is influenced by its direct causes. They support reasoning about manipulating parts of the system and thus hold promise for addressing some of the open challenges of artificial intelligence (AI), such as planning, transferring knowledge in changing environments, or robustness to distribution shifts. However, a key obstacle to more widespread use of causal models in AI is the requirement that the relevant variables be specified a priori, which is typically not the case for the high-dimensional, unstructured data processed by modern AI systems. At the same time, machine learning (ML) has proven quite successful at automatically extracting useful and compact representations of such complex data. Causal representation learning (CRL) aims to combine the core strengths of ML and causality by learning representations in the form of latent variables endowed with causal model semantics. In this thesis, we study and present new results for different CRL settings. A central theme is the question of identifiability: Given infinite data, when are representations satisfying the same learning objective guaranteed to be equivalent? This is an important prerequisite for CRL, as it formally characterises if and when a learning task is, at least in principle, feasible. Since learning causal models, even without a representation learning component, is notoriously difficult, we require additional assumptions on the model class or rich data beyond the classical i.i.d. setting. By partially characterising identifiability for different settings, this thesis investigates what is possible for CRL without direct supervision, and thus contributes to its theoretical foundations. Ideally, the developed insights can help inform data collection practices or inspire the design of new practical estimation methods.">

Predictive tools, capable of classifying cancer cells based on their functions, may substantially enhance therapy and extend patient life span. The connection between cell biomechanics and cancer cell functions is used here to classify cells through mechanical measurements, via particle uptake. Machine learning (ML) was used to classify cells based on single-cell patterns of uptake of particles with diverse sizes. Three pairs of human cancer cell subpopulations, varied in their level of drug resistance or malignancy, were studied. Cells were allowed to interact with fluorescently labeled polystyrene particles ranging in size from 0.04 to 3.36 μm and analyzed for their uptake patterns using flow cytometry. ML algorithms accurately classified cancer cell subtypes with accuracy rates exceeding 95%. The uptake data were especially advantageous for morphologically similar cell subpopulations. Moreover, the uptake data were found to serve as a form of "normalization" that could reduce variation in repeated experiments.">

        <tr id="The estimation of directed couplings between the nodes of a network from indirect measurements is a central methodological challenge in scientific fields such as neuroscience, systems biology and economics. Unfortunately, the problem is generally ill-posed due to the possible presence of unknown delays in the measurements. In this paper, we offer a solution of this problem by using a variational Bayes framework, where the uncertainty over the delays is marginalized in order to obtain conservative coupling estimates. To overcome the well-known overconfidence of classical variational methods, we use a hybrid-VI scheme where the (possibly flat or multimodal) posterior over the measurement parameters is estimated using a forward KL loss while the (nearly convex) conditional posterior over the couplings is estimated using the highly scalable gradient-based VI. In our ground-truth experiments, we show that the network provides reliable and conservative estimates of the couplings, greatly outperforming similar methods such as regression DCM.">

In order to translate data from immune profiling assays into powerful diagnostics, machine learning approaches are used to compute per-sample immunological summaries, or featurizations that can be used as inputs to models for outcomes of interest. Current supervised learning approaches for computing per-sample representations are optimized based only on the outcome variable to be predicted and do not take into account clinically-relevant covariates that are likely to also be measured. Here we expand the optimization problem to also take into account such additional patient covariates to directly inform the learned per-sample representations. To do this, we introduce CytoCoSet, a set-based encoding method, which formulates a loss function with an additional triplet term penalizing samples with similar covariates from having disparate embedding results in per-sample representations. Overall, incorporating clinical covariates leads to improved prediction of clinical phenotypes.">

Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.">

        <tr id="We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.">

        <tr id="In this study, we develop and implement the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to forecast the rate of change in tumor cells, healthy host cells, and effector immune cells within the Itik-Banks model. This novel application of EKF in cancer dynamics modeling aims to provide precise real-time estimations of cellular interactions, especially in constructing a new state space representation from the Itik-Banks model. We use a first-order Taylor series to linearize the model. The numerical simulations were performed to analyze the accuracy of this new state space with data from William Gilpin’s GitHub repository. The results show that the EKF predictions strongly align with actual data, i.e., in the prior and posterior steps for tumor and healthy host cells, there is a strong agreement between the predictions and the actual data. The EKF captures the oscillatory nature of the tumor and healthy host cell population well. The peaks and troughs of the predictions align closely with the actual data, indicating the EKF’s effectiveness in modeling the dynamic behavior of the tumor and healthy host cells. However, for effector immune cells, the oscillatory nature of the data in these cells gives rise to slight deviations. This represents a significant challenge in the future for updating the state space representations. Despite minor discrepancies, the EKF demonstrates a strong performance in both the training and testing data, with the posterior step estimates significantly improving the prior step accuracy. This study emphasizes the importance of data availability for accurate predictions, noting a symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (sMAPE) of 35.92% when data is unavailable. Prompt correction with new data is essential to maintain accuracy. This research underscores the EKF’s potential for real-time monitoring and prediction in complex biological systems.">

        <tr id="Introduction: For many decades, the management of cancer has utilized radiation therapy, which continues to evolve with technology to improve patient outcomes. However, despite the standardization of treatment plans and the establishment of best clinical practices based on prospective, randomized trials and adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the outcomes from radiation therapy are highly variable and dependent on a number of factors, including patient demographics, tumor characteristics/histology, and treatment parameters. In this study, we attempt to use available patient data and treatment parameters at the time of radiation therapy to predict future outcomes using artificial intelligence (AI). Methods: Six thousand five hundred ninety-five cases of patients who completed radiation treatment were selected retrospectively and used to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) and baseline models (i.e., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines [SVMs], gradient boosting [XGBoost]) for binary classification of mortality at multiple time points ranging from six months to five years post-treatment. A hyperparameter grid search was used to identify the optimal network architecture for each time point, using sensitivity as the primary outcome metric. Results: The median age was 75 years (range: 2-102 years). There were 63.8% females and 36.1% males. The results indicate that ANNs were able to successfully perform binary mortality prediction with an accuracy greater than random chance and greater sensitivity than baseline models used. The best-performing algorithm was the ANN, which achieved a sensitivity of 83.00% ± 4.89% for five-year mortality. Conclusion: The neural network was able to achieve higher sensitivity than Logistic Regression, SVM Random Forest, and XGBoost across all output target variables, demonstrating the utility of a neural network model for mortality prediction on the provided dataset.">

We demonstrate that classical multi-edge network models, such as the $G(N,p)$, configuration models, and stochastic block models, fail to accurately capture this phenomenon. To mitigate this issue, zero-inflation must be integrated into these traditional models. Through zero-inflation, we incorporate a mechanism that accounts for the excess number of zeroes (disconnected pairs) observed in empirical data. By performing an analysis on all the datasets from the Sociopatterns repository, we illustrate how zero-inflated models more accurately reflect the sparsity and heavy-tailed edge count distributions observed in empirical data. Our findings underscore that failing to account for these ubiquitous properties in real-world networks inadvertently leads to biased models which do not accurately represent complex systems and their dynamics.">

        <tr id="The estimation of Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) is crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of treatment effects in clinical trials. We evaluate the performance of common methods, including causal forests and various meta-learners, across a diverse set of scenarios, revealing that each of the methods struggles in one or more of the tested scenarios. Given the inherent uncertainty of the data-generating process in real-life scenarios, the robustness of a CATE estimator to various scenarios is critical for its reliability. To address this limitation of existing methods, we propose two new ensemble methods that integrate multiple estimators to enhance prediction stability and performance - Stacked X-Learner which uses the X-Learner with model stacking for estimating the nuisance functions, and Consensus Based Averaging (CBA), which averages only the models with highest internal agreement. We show that these models achieve good performance across a wide range of scenarios varying in complexity, sample size and structure of the underlying-mechanism, including a biologically driven model for PD-L1 inhibition pathway for cancer treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrate improved performance by the Stacked X-Learner also when comparing to other ensemble methods, including R-Stacking, Causal-Stacking and others.">

Reliably sampling from high-value regions beyond the training data, however, remains an open challenge -- with current methods predominantly focusing on modifying the diffusion process itself. In this paper, we develop context-guided diffusion (CGD), a simple plug-and-play method that leverages unlabeled data and smoothness constraints to improve the out-of-distribution generalization of guided diffusion models. We demonstrate that this approach leads to substantial performance gains across various settings, including continuous, discrete, and graph-structured diffusion processes with applications across drug discovery, materials science, and protein design.">

        <tr id="Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.">

        <tr id="A growing number of mathematical models have been developed, providing a powerful means to forecast tumor growth. These models hold great promise as tools in the advancement of personalized medical care. Yet, their clinical relevance often remains restricted. Adequate parameter estimation and integration of existing clinical data from the patient is crucial for individualized predictions. Since CT scans form an integral part of radiotherapy, a widely used cancer treatment, we propose the use of CT-derived radiomic features to attempt to predict the course of tumor growth curves. Therefore, in this exploratory study, we examine the association between radiomic features and the three parameters of the Gompertz tumor growth model. As a proof of concept, murine tumor growth (CT26) is monitored and the Gompertz model is fitted to each animal's data to obtain the parameters. Radiomic features of the tumors were then obtained via CT, which were subsequently analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. Finally, correlations between the two were computed. We were able to discover latent factors within the radiomic features that revealed significant correlations with the parameters of the Gompertz model. Additionally, distinct features exhibiting strong correlations with the factors were identified. These may be instrumental in predicting future tumor growth. These findings offer encouraging preliminary evidence for supporting the notion that CT scans contain information that can estimate the future course of tumor growth curves. This approach opens up promising possibilities for personalized medicine in oncology, by facilitating the development of treatment plans tailored to individual patients' tumor growth patterns, right from the time of diagnosis.">

We propose a time-dependent undirected graphical model that ensures temporal and structural smoothness across time-specific networks to examine the trajectories of interactions between markers aligned at the time of disease onset. Specifically, we anchor subjects relative to the time of disease diagnosis (anchoring time) as in a revival process, and we estimate networks at each time point of interest relative to the anchoring time. To use all available data, we apply kernel weights to borrow information across observations that are close to the time of interest. Adaptive lasso weights are introduced to encourage temporal smoothness in edge strength, while a novel elastic fused- l 0 $$ {l}_0 $$ penalty removes spurious edges and encourages temporal smoothness in network structure. Our approach can handle practical complications such as unbalanced visit times. We conduct simulation studies to compare our approach with existing methods.

        <tr id="Single-cell multi-omics technologies have empowered increasingly refined characterisation of the heterogeneity of cell populations. Automated cell type annotation methods have been developed to transfer cell type labels from well-annotated reference datasets to emerging query datasets. However, these methods suffer from some common caveats, including the failure to characterise transitional and novel cell states, sensitivity to batch effects and under-utilisation of phenotypic information other than cell types (e.g. sample source and disease conditions). We developed Φ-Space, a computational framework for the continuous phenotyping of single-cell multi-omics data. In Φ-Space we adopt a highly versatile modelling strategy to continuously characterise query cell identity in a low-dimensional phenotype space, defined by reference phenotypes. The phenotype space embedding enables various downstream analyses, including insightful visualisations, clustering and cell type labelling. We demonstrate through three case studies that Φ-Space (i) characterises developing and out-of-reference cell states; (ii) is robust against batch effects in both reference and query; (iii) adapts to annotation tasks involving multiple omics types; (iv) overcomes technical differences between reference and query. The versatility of Φ-Space makes it applicable to a wide range analytical tasks beyond cell type transfer, and its ability to model complex phenotypic variation will facilitate biological discoveries from different omics types.">

Many supervised machine learning approaches have been designed to build sequence-based predictive models of such specificity using binding and non-binding examples of data. Due to the presence of few specific and many non-specific T-cell receptors for each antigen, available datasets are heavily imbalanced and make the goal of achieving solid predictive performances very challenging. Here, we propose to restore data balance through data augmentation using generative unsupervised models. We then use these augmented data to train supervised models for prediction of peptide-specific T-cell receptors and binding pairs of peptide and T-cell receptors sequences. We show that our pipeline yields increased performance in terms of T-cell receptors specificity prediction tasks. More broadly, our work provides a general framework to restore balance in computational problems involving biological sequence data. Significance Statement The adaptive immune system carries a diverse set of T-cell receptors capable of recognizing pathogens and protect the host from diseases. Predicting whether a receptor binds a pathogenic peptide is a fundamental computational problem, made difficult by the imbalance in available data: relatively few binding pairs are known compared to all possible pairs of receptors and peptides. Here, we propose to mitigate this imbalance problem by generating putative binding pairs through data augmentation machine-learning methods. We show that these extra data helps training binding prediction models and improves their performances. Our framework for sequence data augmentation is generic and could be applied to other biological computational problems.">

        <tr id="Bayesian graphical models are powerful tools to infer complex relationships in high dimension, yet are often fraught with computational and statistical challenges. If exploited in a principled way, the increasing information collected alongside the data of primary interest constitutes an opportunity to mitigate these difficulties by guiding the detection of dependence structures. For instance, gene network inference may be informed by the use of publicly available summary statistics on the regulation of genes by genetic variants. Here we present a novel Gaussian graphical modeling framework to identify and leverage information on the centrality of nodes in conditional independence graphs. Specifically, we consider a fully joint hierarchical model to simultaneously infer (i) sparse precision matrices and (ii) the relevance of node-level information for uncovering the sought-after network structure. We encode such information as candidate auxiliary variables using a spike-and-slab submodel on the propensity of nodes to be hubs, which allows hypothesis-free selection and interpretation of a sparse subset of relevant variables. As efficient exploration of large posterior spaces is needed for real-world applications, we develop a variational expectation conditional maximization algorithm that scales inference to hundreds of samples, nodes and auxiliary variables. We illustrate and exploit the advantages of our approach in simulations and in a gene network study which identifies hub genes involved in biological pathways relevant to immune-mediated diseases.">

We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented.

        <tr id="Background A number of deep learning models have been developed to predict epigenetic features such as chromatin accessibility from DNA sequence. Model evaluations commonly report performance genome-wide; however, cis regulatory elements (CREs), which play critical roles in gene regulation, make up only a small fraction of the genome. Furthermore, cell type specific CREs contain a large proportion of complex disease heritability. Results We evaluate genomic deep learning models in chromatin accessibility regions with varying degrees of cell type specificity. We assess two modeling directions in the field: general purpose models trained across thousands of outputs (cell types and epigenetic marks), and models tailored to specific tissues and tasks. We find that the accuracy of genomic deep learning models, including two state-of-the-art general purpose models – Enformer and Sei – varies across the genome and is reduced in cell type specific accessible regions. Using accessibility models trained on cell types from specific tissues, we find that increasing model capacity to learn cell type specific regulatory syntax – through single-task learning or high capacity multi-task models – can improve performance in cell type specific accessible regions. We also observe that improving reference sequence predictions does not consistently improve variant effect predictions, indicating that novel strategies are needed to improve performance on variants. Conclusions Our results provide a new perspective on the performance of genomic deep learning models, showing that performance varies across the genome and is particularly reduced in cell type specific accessible regions. We also identify strategies to maximize performance in cell type specific accessible regions.">

However, the heterogeneity of clone-specific kinetics remains understudied, both quantitatively and in terms of interpretability, thus limiting the power of bar-coding systems to unravel how heterogeneous stem cell clones drive overall cell population dynamics. Here, we present CLADES, a NeuralODE-based framework to faithfully estimate clone-specific kinetics of cell states from newly generated and publicly available human cord blood LARRY LT-scSeq data. By incorporating a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and differential expression gene (DEGs) analysis, CLADES yields cell division dynamics across differentiation timecourses and fate bias predictions for the early progenitor cells. Moreover, clone-level quantitative behaviours can be grouped into characteristic types by pooling individual clones into meta-clones. By benchmarking with CoSpar, we found that CLADES improves fate bias prediction accuracy at the meta-clone level. In conclusion, we report a broadly applicable approach to robustly quantify differentiation kinetics using meta-clones while providing valuable insights into the fate bias of cellular populations for any organ system maintained by a pool of heterogeneous stem and progenitor cells.">

In brain connectomics, the focus is on inferring common relationships among the brain regions, while characterizing inter-individual variability in an easily interpretable manner.

        <tr id="Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), a common disease that can have serious consequences, occurs when myocardial blood flow stops due to occlusion of the coronary artery. Early and accurate prediction of AMI is critical for rapid prognosis and improved patient outcomes. Metabolomics, the study of small molecules within biological systems, is an effective tool used to discover biomarkers associated with many diseases. This study intended to construct a predictive model for AMI utilizing metabolomics data and an explainable machine learning approach called Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM). The EBM model was trained on a dataset of 102 prognostic metabolites gathered from 99 individuals, including 34 healthy controls and 65 AMI patients. After a comprehensive data preprocessing, 21 metabolites were determined as the candidate predictors to predict AMI. The EBM model displayed satisfactory performance in predicting AMI, with various classification performance metrics. The model’s predictions were based on the combined effects of individual metabolites and their interactions. In this context, the results obtained in two different EBM modeling, including both only individual metabolite features and their interaction effects, were discussed. The most important predictors included creatinine, nicotinamide, and isocitrate. These metabolites are involved in different biological activities, such as energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cellular signaling. The results demonstrate the potential of the combination of metabolomics and the EBM model in constructing reliable and interpretable prediction outputs for AMI. The discussed metabolite biomarkers may assist in early diagnosis, risk assessment, and personalized treatment methods for AMI patients. This study successfully developed a pipeline incorporating extensive data preprocessing and the EBM model to identify potential metabolite biomarkers for predicting AMI. The EBM model, with its ability to incorporate interaction terms, demonstrated satisfactory classification performance and revealed significant metabolite interactions that could be valuable in assessing AMI risk. However, the results obtained from this study should be validated with studies to be carried out in larger and well-defined samples.">

Building a causal diagram can help understand user behavior in transitioning between websites, inspiring operational strategy. A challenge in modeling is user heterogeneity, as users with different backgrounds exhibit varied behaviors. Additionally, social network connections can result in similar behaviors among friends. We introduce personalized Binomial DAG models to address heterogeneity and network dependency between observations, which are common in real-world applications. To learn the proposed DAG model, we develop an algorithm that embeds the network structure into a dimension-reduced covariate, learns each node's neighborhood to reduce the DAG search space, and explores the variance-mean relation to determine the ordering. Simulations show our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in heterogeneous data. We demonstrate its practical usefulness on a real-world web visit dataset.">

However, quantifying uncertainty on high-dimensional predictions is still a severely under-invested problem, especially when input-output relationships are non-linear. To handle this problem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines autoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities of Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional representation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian method that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs and outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to surrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings highlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as accurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to external forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.">

        <tr id="Predicting the physico-chemical properties of pure substances and mixtures is a central task in thermodynamics. Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab-initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure-property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.">

        <tr id="This study assesses the predictive performance of six machine learning models and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in forecasting tumor dynamics within three months following Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) in 77 brain metastasis (BM) patients. The analysis meticulously evaluates each model before and after hyperparameter tuning, utilizing accuracy, AUC, and other metrics derived from confusion matrices. The CNN model showcased notable performance with an accuracy of 98% and an AUC of 0.97, effectively complementing the broader model analysis. Initial findings highlighted that XGBoost significantly outperformed other models with an accuracy of 0.95 and an AUC of 0.95 before tuning. Post-tuning, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) demonstrated the most substantial improvement, achieving an accuracy of 0.98 and an AUC of 0.98. Conversely, XGBoost showed a decline in performance after tuning, indicating potential overfitting. The study also explores feature importance across models, noting that features like “control at one year”, “age of the patient”, and “beam-on time for volume V1 treated” were consistently influential across various models, albeit their impacts were interpreted differently depending on the model’s underlying mechanics. This comprehensive evaluation not only underscores the importance of model selection and hyperparameter tuning but also highlights the practical implications in medical diagnostic scenarios, where the accuracy of positive predictions can be crucial. Our research explores the effects of staged Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) on larger tumors, revealing no significant outcome differences across protocols. It uniquely considers the impact of beam-on time and fraction intervals on treatment efficacy. However, the investigation is limited by a small patient cohort and data from a single institution, suggesting the need for future multicenter research.">

In particular, we focus on estimating states for which neither direct observational data nor constitutive equations are available. We propose an easy-to-apply heuristic to assess whether estimation of such states may be possible. As numerical examples, we consider a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

        <tr id="Many clinical trials generate both longitudinal biomarker and time-to-event data. We might be interested in their relationship, as in the case of tumor size and overall survival in oncology drug development. Many well-established methods exist for analyzing such data either sequentially (two-stage models) or simultaneously (joint models). Two-stage modeling (2stgM) has been challenged (i) for not acknowledging that biomarkers are endogenous covariable to the survival submodel and (ii) for not propagating the uncertainty of the longitudinal biomarker submodel to the survival submodel. On the other hand, joint modeling (JM), which properly circumvents both problems, has been criticized for being time-consuming, and difficult to use in practice. In this paper, we explore a third approach, referred to as a novel two-stage modeling (N2stgM). This strategy reduces the model complexity without compromising the parameter estimate accuracy. The three approaches (2stgM, JM, and N2stgM) are formulated, and a Bayesian framework is considered for their implementation. Both real and simulated data were used to analyze the performance of such approaches. In all scenarios, our proposal estimated the parameters approximately as JM but without being computationally expensive, while 2stgM produced biased results.">

Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

        <tr id="In the real world, many dynamic behaviors can be explained by the propagation of perturbations, such as the transfer of chemical signals and the spread of infectious diseases. Previous researchers have achieved excellent results in approximating the global propagation time, revealing the mechanism of signal propagation through multiple paths. However, the known frameworks rely on the extension of physical concepts rather than mathematically rigorous derivations. As a result, they may not perfectly predict time or explain the underlying physical significance in certain specific cases. In this paper, we propose a novel method for decomposing network topology, focusing on two modules: the tree-like module and the path-module. Subsequently, we introduce a new framework for signal propagation analysis, which can be applied to estimate the propagation time for two fundamental global topology modules and provide a rigorous proof for the propagation time in global topology. Compared to previous work, our results are not only more concise, clearly defined, efficient, but also are more powerful in predicting propagation time which outperforms some known results in some cases, for example, biochemical dynamics.Additionally, the proposed framework is based on information transfer pathways, which can be also applied to other physical fields, such as network stability, network controlling and network resilience.">

        <tr id="1614 Background: Despite the unique ability of machine learning (ML) techniques to uncover complex interactive effects in datasets, studies exploring predictors of clinical trial enrollment have largely used standard statistical methods to discern associations. Furthermore, there have been limited applications of ML to close existing disparities in clinical trial enrollment of underrepresented patients in neuro-oncology. This study aims to use supervised machine learning to define and validate primary contributors of therapeutic clinical trial enrollment for a) all patients, b) women and c) NIH-designated minority patients with low- and high-grade glioma. Methods: Adult glioma patients who received care from the UCSF Brain Tumor Center between 1997- 2017 were identified in a prospective registry. Bootstrap forest (BF) and Recursive Partitioning (RP) models were created by randomly dividing patients in a 70/30 split into development (DEV) and validation (VAL) cohorts among all patients, women, and NIH-designated minority patients, separately. Model performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) in the DEV and VAL cohorts. Results: Among 1042 patients, 350 patients (33.6%) enrolled in a therapeutic clinical trial. There were 445 women (42.7%), of which 144 (32.4%) enrolled, and 141 minority patients (13.5%), of which 39 (27.7%) enrolled. For all patients, in order of decreasing influence, the BF model selected median neighborhood household income, age, neighborhood poverty level, distance from hospital, tumor location, tumor volume, treatment with chemotherapy, occupation, KPS, insurance status, employment status, seizure at presentation, and volumetric extent of resection (EOR) to predict trial enrollment (DEV AUC: 0.984; VAL AUC: 0.746). For women, the BF model selected distance from hospital, age, household income, neighborhood poverty level, tumor location, treatment with chemotherapy, and KPS for trial prediction (DEV AUC: 0.972; VAL AUC: 0.746), whereas for minority patients, the BF model selected neighborhood poverty level, age, occupation, distance from hospital, tumor volume, insurance status, employment status, and EOR to predict trial enrollment (DEV AUC: 0.9830; VAL AUC: 0.769). The RP model for women designated those with non-White race as less likely to enroll (DEV AUC: 0.735; VAL AUC: 0.665) while the RP model for minority patients characterized those who preferred a non-English language or who were divorced or widowed as less likely to enroll (DEV AUC: 0.775; VAL AUC: 0.601). Conclusions: Supervised machine learning models achieved similar predictive performance among patient subgroups, while uncovering interactions between gender identity, minority status, and sociodemographic variables. These findings can guide targeted recruiting efforts to advance equitable trial enrollment for women and minorities.">

        <tr id="Multiscale models provide a unique tool for studying complex processes that study events occurring at different scales across space and time. In the context of biological systems, such models can simulate mechanisms happening at the intracellular level such as signaling, and at the extracellular level where cells communicate and coordinate with other cells. They aim to understand the impact of genetic or environmental deregulation observed in complex diseases, describe the interplay between a pathological tissue and the immune system, and suggest strategies to revert the diseased phenotypes. The construction of these multiscale models remains a very complex task, including the choice of the components to consider, the level of details of the processes to simulate, or the fitting of the parameters to the data. One additional difficulty is the expert knowledge needed to program these models in languages such as C++ or Python, which may discourage the participation of non-experts. Simplifying this process through structured description formalisms — coupled with a graphical interface — is crucial in making modeling more accessible to the broader scientific community, as well as streamlining the process for advanced users. This article introduces three examples of multiscale models which rely on the framework PhysiBoSS, an add-on of PhysiCell that includes intracellular descriptions as continuous time Boolean models to the agent-based approach. The article demonstrates how to easily construct such models, relying on PhysiCell Studio, the PhysiCell Graphical User Interface.

        <tr id="This paper presents a thorough examination for drug release from a polymeric matrix to improve understanding of drug release behavior for tissue regeneration. A comprehensive model was developed utilizing mass transfer and machine learning (ML). In the machine learning section, three distinct regression models, namely, Decision Tree Regression (DTR), Passive Aggressive Regression (PAR), and Quadratic Polynomial Regression (QPR) applied to a comprehensive dataset of drug release. The dataset includes r(m) and z(m) inputs, with corresponding concentration of solute in the matrix (C) as response. The primary objective is to assess and compare the predictive performance of these models in finding the correlation between input parameters and chemical concentrations. The hyper-parameter optimization process is executed using Sequential Model-Based Optimization (SMBO), ensuring the robustness of the models in handling the complexity of the controlled drug release. The Decision Tree Regression model exhibits outstanding predictive accuracy, with an R2 score of 0.99887, RMSE of 9.0092E-06, MAE of 3.51486E-06, and a Max Error of 6.87000E-05. This exceptional performance underscores the model’s capability to discern intricate patterns within the drug release dataset. The Passive Aggressive Regression model, while displaying a slightly lower R2 score of 0.94652, demonstrates commendable predictive capabilities with an RMSE of 6.0438E-05, MAE of 4.82782E-05, and a Max Error of 2.36600E-04. The model’s effectiveness in capturing non-linear relationships within the dataset is evident. The Quadratic Polynomial Regression model, designed to accommodate quadratic relationships, yields a noteworthy R2 score of 0.95382, along with an RMSE of 5.6655E-05, MAE of 4.49198E-05, and a Max Error of 1.86375E-04. These results affirm the model’s proficiency in capturing the inherent complexities of the drug release system.">

To escape local optima, our optimization is modeled as a Markov decision process using reinforcement learning acting directly in latent space. We evaluate our approach on two important fitness optimization tasks, demonstrating its ability to achieve comparable or superior fitness over baseline methods.

Existing statistical methods, for the sake of numerical convergence, pose strong constraints on the form of predicted mutation patterns, so they easily identify sub-optimally fitted clones that overlook weak and rare mutations. To solve this problem, we developed SNPmanifold, a Python package that learns flexible mutation patterns using a shallow binomial variational autoencoder. The latent space of SNPmanifold can effectively represent and visualize complex mutations of SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) in the form of geometrical manifolds. Based on nuclear or mitochondrial SNPs, we demonstrated that SNPmanifold can effectively identify a large number of multiplexed donors of origin (k = 18) that all existing unsupervised methods fail and lineages of somatic clones with promising biological interpretation. Therefore, SNPmanifold can reveal insights into single-cell SNPs more comprehensively than other existing methods, especially in complex datasets.">

        <tr id="To make accurate predictions, understand mechanisms, and design interventions in systems of many variables, we wish to learn causal graphs from large scale data. Unfortunately the space of all possible causal graphs is enormous so scalably and accurately searching for the best fit to the data is a challenge. In principle we could substantially decrease the search space, or learn the graph entirely, by testing the conditional independence of variables. However, deciding if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph may require an exponential number of tests. Here we build a scalable and flexible method to evaluate if two variables are adjacent in a causal graph, the Differentiable Adjacency Test (DAT). DAT replaces an exponential number of tests with a provably equivalent relaxed problem. It then solves this problem by training two neural networks. We build a graph learning method based on DAT, DAT-Graph, that can also learn from data with interventions. DAT-Graph can learn graphs of 1000 variables with state of the art accuracy. Using the graph learned by DAT-Graph, we also build models that make much more accurate predictions of the effects of interventions on large scale RNA sequencing data.">

        <tr id="The key goals in learning Bayesian networks (BNs) from data are to identify significant statistical relationships between variables and to build a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents these relationships through Joint Probability Distributions. Most research relies on score-based or conditional test methods for model selection. However, when using real-world data, it can be challenging to identify whether the learned DAG represents the underlying relations inherent in the limited datasets, particularly when evaluating data obtained from multiple independent sources. This study presents a methodology to assess the credible interval for both the existence and direction of each edge within Bayesian networks derived from data. Furthermore, it explores the fusion of models acquired from distinct and independent datasets. This approach enables the Bayesian learning of Bayesian Networks (BNs) from data by treating the uncertainty associated with the existence and orientation of each edge as a random variable. By evaluating the probability of the orientation of each edge, it is possible to suggest the existence of a potential latent variable within the dataset. If an edge exhibits equiprobable directions and is verified to exist, it becomes a plausible hypothesis for a latent variable. The Fast Causal Algorithm, originally introduced by [1], is the foundation of this approach. Finally, by employing a maximum a posteriori estimation, the most prominent edges and their respective orientations are identified and employed to create the leading DAG. We present our findings in simulated datasets with different length sizes. By comparing the structure of the learned DAGs with existing structures and evaluating the inference capabilities of the final BN, we establish that our approach achieves results comparable to the most recent studies in the field, while offering insights into the model’s reliability and improving the use of the data.">

        <tr id="Through integrating the evolutionary correlations across global states in the bidirectional recursion, an explainable Bayesian recurrent neural smoother (EBRNS) is proposed for offline data-assisted fixed-interval state smoothing. At first, the proposed model, containing global states in the evolutionary interval, is transformed into an equivalent model with bidirectional memory. This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

Importantly, recent advances in enhanced sampling methodology have facilitated the characterization of multidimensional free energy landscapes, often exposing multiple thermodynamically important minima missed by more restrictive sampling methods. A key to the effectiveness of this multidimensional sampling approach is the identification of collective variables that effectively define the configurational space of dissociated and associated states. Here we present the application of two machine learning methods for the unbiased determination of collective variables for enhanced sampling and analysis of protein-protein association.

        <tr id="Predicting cancer-associated clinical events is challenging in oncology. In Multiple Myeloma (MM), a cancer of plasma cells, disease progression is determined by changes in biomarkers, such as serum concentration of the paraprotein secreted by plasma cells (M-protein). Therefore, the time-dependent behaviour of M-protein and the transition across lines of therapy (LoT) that may be a consequence of disease progression should be accounted for in statistical models to predict relevant clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is important to understand the contribution of the patterns of longitudinal biomarkers, upon each LoT initiation, to time-to-death or time-to-next-LoT. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a Bayesian joint model for trajectories of multiple longitudinal biomarkers, such as M-protein, and the competing risks of death and transition to next LoT. Additionally, we explore two estimation approaches for our joint model: simultaneous estimation of all parameters (joint estimation) and sequential estimation of parameters using a corrected two-stage strategy aiming to reduce computational time. Our proposed model and estimation methods are applied to a retrospective cohort study from a real-world database of patients diagnosed with MM in the US from January 2015 to February 2022. We split the data into training and test sets in order to validate the joint model using both estimation approaches and make dynamic predictions of times until clinical events of interest, informed by longitudinally measured biomarkers and baseline variables available up to the time of prediction.">

        <tr id="Therapeutic interventions are designed to perturb the function of a biological system. However, there are many types of proteins that cannot be targeted with conventional small molecule drugs. Accordingly, many identified gene-regulatory drivers and downstream effectors are currently undruggable. Drivers and effectors are often connected by druggable signaling and regulatory intermediates. Methods to identify druggable intermediates therefore have general value in expanding the set of targets available for hypothesis-driven validation. Here we identify and prioritize potential druggable intermediates by developing a network perturbation theory, termed NetPert, for response functions of biological networks. Dynamics are defined by a network structure in which vertices represent genes and proteins, and edges represent gene-regulatory interactions and protein-protein interactions. Perturbation theory for network dynamics prioritizes targets that interfere with signaling from driver to response genes. Applications to organoid models for metastatic breast cancer demonstrate the ability of this mathematical framework to identify and prioritize druggable intermediates. While the short-time limit of the perturbation theory resembles betweenness centrality, NetPert is superior in generating target rankings that correlate with previous wet-lab assays and are more robust to incomplete or noisy network data. NetPert also performs better than a related graph diffusion approach. Wet-lab assays demonstrate that drugs for targets identified by NetPert, including targets that are not themselves differentially expressed, are active in suppressing additional metastatic phenotypes.">

Having access to an underlying causal graph comes with the promise of cause–effect estimation and the identification of efficient and safe interventions. However, learning causal representations remains a major challenge, due to the complexity of many real-world systems. Previous works on causal representation learning have mostly focused on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs). These methods only provide representations from a point estimate, and they are less effective at handling high dimensions. To overcome these problems, we propose a Diffusion-based Causal Representation Learning (DCRL) framework which uses diffusion-based representations for causal discovery in the latent space. DCRL provides access to both single-dimensional and infinite-dimensional latent codes, which encode different levels of information. In a first proof of principle, we investigate the use of DCRL for causal representation learning in a weakly supervised setting. We further demonstrate experimentally that this approach performs comparably well in identifying the latent causal structure and causal variables.">

Despite the increase in statistical methods designed to identify spatially variable genes, they are mostly based on marginal analysis and share the limitation that the dependence (network) structures among genes are not well accommodated, where a biological process usually involves changes in multiple genes that interact in a complex network. Moreover, the latent cellular composition within spots may introduce confounding variations, negatively affecting identification accuracy. In this study, we develop a novel Bayesian regularization approach for spatial transcriptomic data, with the confounding variations induced by varying cellular distributions effectively corrected. Significantly advancing from the existing studies, a thresholded graph Laplacian regularization is proposed to simultaneously identify spatially variable genes and accommodate the network structure among genes. The proposed method is based on a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution, effectively accommodating the count nature, zero inflation, and overdispersion of spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive simulations and the application to real data demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed method.">

        <tr id="With the development of high-throughput technologies, genomics datasets rapidly grow in size, including functional genomics data. This has allowed the training of large Deep Learning (DL) models to predict epigenetic readouts, such as protein binding or histone modifications, from genome sequences. However, large dataset sizes come at a price of data consistency, often aggregating results from a large number of studies, conducted under varying experimental conditions. While data from large-scale consortia are useful as they allow studying the effects of different biological conditions, they can also contain unwanted biases from confounding experimental factors. Here, we introduce Metadata-guided Feature Disentanglement (MFD) - an approach that allows disentangling biologically relevant features from potential technical biases. MFD incorporates target metadata into model training, by conditioning weights of the model output layer on different experimental factors. It then separates the factors into disjoint groups and enforces independence of the corresponding feature subspaces with an adversarially learned penalty. We show that the metadata-driven disentanglement approach allows for better model introspection, by connecting latent features to experimental factors, without compromising, or even improving performance in downstream tasks, such as enhancer prediction, or genetic variant discovery. The code for our implemementation is available at https://github.com/HealthML/MFD">

Those methods aim to streamline the analysis of scRNA-seq data by focusing on the most informative genes that contribute significantly to the specific analysis task. Traditional selection methods, which often rely on expert domain knowledge, embedded machine learning models, or heuristic-based iterative optimization, are prone to biases and inefficiencies that may obscure critical genomic signals. Recognizing the limitations of traditional methods, we aim to transcend these constraints with a refined strategy. In this study, we introduce an iterative gene panel selection strategy that is applicable to clustering tasks in single-cell genomics. Our method uniquely integrates results from other gene selection algorithms, providing valuable preliminary boundaries or prior knowledge as initial guides in the search space to enhance the efficiency of our framework. Furthermore, we incorporate the stochastic nature of the exploration process in reinforcement learning (RL) and its capability for continuous optimization through reward-based feedback. This combination mitigates the biases inherent in the initial boundaries and harnesses RL's adaptability to refine and target gene panel selection dynamically. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted detailed comparative experiments, case studies, and visualization analysis.">

        <tr id="Genotype-to-phenotype mapping is an essential problem in the current genomic era. While qualitative case-control predictions have received significant attention, less emphasis has been placed on predicting quantitative phenotypes. This emerging field holds great promise in revealing intricate connections between microbial communities and host health. However, the presence of heterogeneity in microbiome datasets poses a substantial challenge to the accuracy of predictions and undermines the reproducibility of models. To tackle this challenge, we investigated 22 normalization methods that aimed at removing heterogeneity across multiple datasets, conducted a comprehensive review of them, and evaluated their effectiveness in predicting quantitative phenotypes in three simulation scenarios and 31 real datasets. The results indicate that none of these methods demonstrate significant superiority in predicting quantitative phenotypes or attain a noteworthy reduction in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the predictions. Given the frequent occurrence of batch effects and the satisfactory performance of batch correction methods in predicting datasets affected by these effects, we strongly recommend utilizing batch correction methods as the initial step in predicting quantitative phenotypes. In summary, the performance of normalization methods in predicting metagenomic data remains a dynamic and ongoing research area. Our study contributes to this field by undertaking a comprehensive evaluation of diverse methods and offering valuable insights into their effectiveness in predicting quantitative phenotypes.">

        <tr id="Motivation Despite the development of several computational methods to predict DNA modifications, two main limitations persist in the current methodologies: 1) All existing models are confined to binary predictor which merely determine the presence or absence of DNA modifications, constraining comprehensive analyses of the interrelations among varied modification types. While multi-class classification models for RNA modifications have been developed, a comparable approach for DNA remains a critical need. 2) The majority of previous studies lack adequate explanations of how models make decisions, relying on the extraction and visualization of attention matrices which identified few motifs, and do not provide sufficient insight into the model decision making process. Result In this study, we introduce iResNetDM, a deep learning model that integrates ResNet and self-attention mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, iResNetDM is the first model capable of distinguishing between four types of DNA modifications. It not only demonstrates high performance across various DNA modifications but also unveils the potential capabilities of CNN and ResNet in this domain. To augment the interpretability of our model, we implemented the integrated gradients technique, which was pivotal in demystifying the model’s decision-making framework, allowing for the successful identification of multiple motifs. Importantly, our model exhibits remarkable robustness, successfully identifying unique motifs across different modifications. Furthermore, we compared the motifs discovered in various modifications, revealing that some motifs share significant sequence similarities which suggests that these motifs may be subjected to different types of modifications, underscoring their potential importance in gene regulation.

        <tr id="Deep learning has been increasingly popular in omics data analysis. Recent works incorporating variable selection into deep learning have greatly enhanced the model’s interpretability. However, because deep learning desires a large sample size, the existing methods may result in uncertain findings when the dataset has a small sample size, commonly seen in omics data analysis. With the explosion and availability of omics data from multiple populations/studies, the existing methods naively pool them into one dataset to enhance the sample size while ignoring that variable structures can differ across datasets, which might lead to inaccurate variable selection results. We propose a penalized integrative deep neural network (PIN) to simultaneously select important variables from multiple datasets. PIN directly aggregates multiple datasets as input and considers both homogeneity and heterogeneity situations among multiple datasets in an integrative analysis framework. Results from extensive simulation studies and applications of PIN to gene expression datasets from elders with different cognitive statuses or ovarian cancer patients at different stages demonstrate that PIN outperforms existing methods with considerably improved performance among multiple datasets. The source code is freely available on Github (rucliyang/PINFunc). We speculate that the proposed PIN method will promote the identification of disease‐related important variables based on multiple studies/datasets from diverse origins.">

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

        <tr id="Radiobiological data, whether obtained at the clinical, biological or molecular level has significantly contributed to a better description and prediction of the individual dose-response to ionizing radiation and a better estimation of the radiation-induced risks. Particularly, over the last seventy years, the amount of radiobiological data has considerably increased, and permitted the mathematical formulas describing dose-response to become less empirical. A better understanding of the basic radiobiological mechanisms has also contributed to establish quantitative inter-correlations between clinical, biological and molecular biomarkers, refining again the mathematical models of description. Today, big data approaches and, more recently, artificial intelligence may finally complete and secure this long process of thinking from the multi-scale description of radiation-induced events to their prediction. Here, we reviewed the major dose-response models applied in radiobiology for quantifying molecular and cellular radiosensitivity and aimed to explain their evolution: Specifically, we highlighted the advances concerning the target theory with the cell survival models and the progressive introduction of the DNA repair process in the mathematical models. Furthermore, we described how the technological advances have changed the description of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics by introducing the important notion of DSB recognition, independent of that of DSB repair. Initially developed separately, target theory on one hand and, DSB recognition and repair, on the other hand may be now fused into a unified model involving the cascade of phosphorylations mediated by the ATM kinase in response to any genotoxic stress.">

Resulting models are validated by predicting condition-specific TF effector concentrations and binding site motif strength based on differential gene expression data alone. We show how reconstructed promoter models can capture multi-scale regulation and disentangle regulator interactions, including resolving the apparent paradox where argR expression is positively correlated with its regulon despite being a repressor. We applied the workflow for all regulator-linked components extracted by ICA, demonstrating the scalability of the workflow to capture the E. coli TRN.

In this paper, we introduce a novel online methodology for detecting changes within the latent structure of a network point process. We focus on block-homogeneous Poisson processes, where latent node memberships determine the rates of the edge processes. We propose a scalable variational procedure which can be applied on large networks in an online fashion via a Bayesian forgetting factor applied to sequential variational approximations to the posterior distribution. The proposed framework is tested on simulated and real-world data, and it rapidly and accurately detects changes to the latent edge process rates, and to the latent node group memberships, both in an online manner. In particular, in an application on the Santander Cycles bike-sharing network in central London, we detect changes within the network related to holiday periods and lockdown restrictions between 2019 and 2020.">

However, existing methods only allow researchers to infer latent variables that explain subjects' behavior in a relatively small class of cognitive models.

Here, we present an approach that extends neural Bayes estimation to learn a direct mapping between experimental data and the targeted latent variable space using recurrent neural networks and simulated datasets. We show that our approach achieves competitive performance in inferring latent variable sequences in both tractable and intractable models. Furthermore, the approach is generalizable across different computational models and is adaptable for both continuous and discrete latent spaces. We then demonstrate its applicability in real world datasets. Our work underscores that combining recurrent neural networks and simulation-based inference to identify latent variable sequences can enable researchers to access a wider class of cognitive models for model-based neural analyses, and thus test a broader set of theories.">

Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Ab‐initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a key method for realistic simulation of complex atomistic systems and processes in nanoscale. In AIMD, finite‐temperature dynamical trajectories are generated by using forces computed from electronic structure calculations. In systems with high numbers of components a typical AIMD run is computationally demanding. On the other hand, machine learning (ML) is a subfield of the artificial intelligence that consist in a set of algorithms that show learning by experience with the use of input and output data where algorithms are capable of analysing and predicting the future. At present, the main application of ML techniques in atomic simulations is the development of new interatomic potentials to correctly describe the potential energy surfaces (PES). This technique is in constant progress since its inception around 30 years ago. The ML potentials combine the advantages of classical and Ab‐initio methods, that is, the efficiency of a simple functional form and the accuracy of first principles calculations. In this article we review the evolution of four generations of machine learning potentials and some of their most notable applications. This review focuses on MLPs based on neural networks. Also, we present a state of art of this topic and future trends. Finally, we report the results of a scientometric study (covering the period 1995–2023) about the impact of ML techniques applied to atomistic simulations, distribution of publications by geographical regions and hot topics investigated in the literature.">

How can the same cellular pathways, proteins, and mutations lead to pathologies with vastly different clinical presentations? And why do individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, face higher chances of cancer emerging throughout their lifetime? Our broad review emphasizes the multi-scale aspect of this type of reasoning. As these examples demonstrate, rather than focusing on a specific organ system or disease, we aim at the new understanding that can be gained. Within this framework, our review calls attention to computational strategies which can be powerful in discovering connections, causalities, predicting clinical outcomes, and are vital for drug discovery. Thus, rather than centering on the clinical features, we draw on the rapidly increasing data on the molecular level, including mutations, isoforms, three-dimensional structures, and expression levels of the respective disease-associated genes. Their integrated analysis, together with chromatin states, can delineate how, despite being connected, neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer differ, and how the same mutations can lead to different clinical symptoms. Here, we seek to uncover the emerging connection between cancer, including pediatric tumors, and neurodevelopmental disorders, and the tantalizing questions that this connection raises.">

        <tr id="Significant interests have recently risen in leveraging sequence-based large language models (LLMs) for drug design. However, most current applications of LLMs in drug discovery lack the ability to comprehend three-dimensional (3D) structures, thereby limiting their effectiveness in tasks that explicitly involve molecular conformations. In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information, including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks, including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only methods. Token-Mol overcomes the precision limitations of token-only models and has the potential to integrate seamlessly with general models such as ChatGPT, paving the way for the development of a universal artificial intelligence drug design model that facilitates rapid and high-quality drug design by experts.">

Recently, learning models based on transformer architectures have revolutionized multiple domains of machine learning, including natural language processing and computer vision. Naturally, there have been ongoing endeavors in adopting these techniques to the chemical domain, resulting in a surge of publications within a short period.

Despite their widespread use for approximating nonlinear PDEs, the majority of these methods neglect fundamental physical laws and lack interpretability. We address these shortcomings by introducing Physics-embedded Fourier Neural Networks (PeFNN) with flexible and explainable error control. PeFNN is designed to enforce momentum conservation and yields interpretable nonlinear expressions by utilizing unique multi-scale momentum-conserving Fourier (MC-Fourier) layers and an element-wise product operation. The MC-Fourier layer is by design translation- and rotation-invariant in the frequency domain, serving as a plug-and-play module that adheres to the laws of momentum conservation. PeFNN establishes a new state-of-the-art in solving widely employed spatiotemporal PDEs and generalizes well across input resolutions. Further, we demonstrate its outstanding performance for challenging real-world applications such as large-scale flood simulations.">

To address this, we introduce Mixture Modeling for Multiple Instance Learning (MMIL), an expectation maximization method that enables the training and calibration of cell-level classifiers using patient-level labels. Our approach can be used to train e.g. lasso logistic regression models, gradient boosted trees, and neural networks. When applied to clinically-annotated, primary patient samples in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), our method accurately identifies cancer cells, generalizes across tissues and treatment timepoints, and selects biologically relevant features. In addition, MMIL is capable of incorporating cell labels into model training when they are known, providing a powerful framework for leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. Mixture Modeling for MIL offers a novel approach for cell classification, with significant potential to advance disease understanding and management, especially in scenarios with unknown gold-standard labels and high dimensionality.">

However, they are most often reported as case studies, lack integration and standardization across platforms, and are therefore hard to objectively compare. In this study, we established a streamlined and diverse toolbox for methods that predict amino acid probabilities inside the Rosetta software framework that allows for the side-by-side comparison of these models. Subsequently, existing protein fitness landscapes were used to benchmark novel self- supervised machine learning methods in realistic protein design settings. We focused on the traditional problems of protein sequence design: sampling and scoring. A major finding of our study is that novel ML approaches are better at purging the sampling space from deleterious mutations. Nevertheless, scoring resulting mutations without model fine-tuning showed no clear improvement over scoring with Rosetta. This study fills an important gap in the field and allows for the first time a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of different ML and biophysical methods. We conclude that ML currently acts as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, biophysical methods in protein design.">

        <tr id="Introduction & Objective: High-risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) account for only ~20% of type 2 diabetes heritability, implying islet genes greatly influence one another to alter diabetes risk. Correlative analysis does not reveal conditional dependencies between key players regulating islet function whereas machine learning (ML) may do so.
 Methods: Using data from 374 genetically diverse mice, we derived models predicting islet function from protein abundance with gradient-boosted decision tree algorithms. Some mice (70%) were used to train the models and the rest were used to validate them. We also applied our models to similar data from other mouse studies and to data from humans to see if the models’ accuracies replicated. We then determined if the models included any known islet regulators, proteins with human orthologues possessing glycemia-related SNPs, and enriched for islet-relevant functional pathways. Finally, using the proteins’ predictive influences as meta-traits, we ran quantitative trait locus (QTL) scans to identify genomic regions altering the influence of proteins on islet function.
 Results: Our analysis revealed < 150 of the ~ 5000 detected proteins sufficiently modeled any one functional trait, with > 90% of a model’s prediction influenced by < 50 proteins. Some models predicted as well or better in the other mouse sets (R > 0.6) and reasonably well in human data (R > 0.5). ML analysis correctly identified the direction of effect for candidates (e.g. DPP8) where prior studies using correlation alone failed. Models for islet traits enriched for pathways potentially relevant for islet function and several unstudied proteins (e.g. CRELD2) present in multiple models have SNPs for glycemia-related traits. Finally, QTL scans revealed genomic regions that may alter the influence of key proteins on islet function and are far from those proteins’ genomic positions.
 Conclusions: ML can be used to identify conditional dependencies regulating islet function.

        <tr id="Latent variable models serve as powerful tools to infer underlying dynamics from observed neural activity. However, due to the absence of ground truth data, prediction benchmarks are often employed as proxies. In this study, we reveal the limitations of the widely-used 'co-smoothing' prediction framework and propose an improved few-shot prediction approach that encourages more accurate latent dynamics. Utilizing a student-teacher setup with Hidden Markov Models, we demonstrate that the high co-smoothing model space can encompass models with arbitrary extraneous dynamics within their latent representations. To address this, we introduce a secondary metric -- a few-shot version of co-smoothing. This involves performing regression from the latent variables to held-out channels in the data using fewer trials. Our results indicate that among models with near-optimal co-smoothing, those with extraneous dynamics underperform in the few-shot co-smoothing compared to 'minimal' models devoid of such dynamics. We also provide analytical insights into the origin of this phenomenon. We further validate our findings on real neural data using two state-of-the-art methods: LFADS and STNDT. In the absence of ground truth, we suggest a proxy measure to quantify extraneous dynamics. By cross-decoding the latent variables of all model pairs with high co-smoothing, we identify models with minimal extraneous dynamics. We find a correlation between few-shot co-smoothing performance and this new measure. In summary, we present a novel prediction metric designed to yield latent variables that more accurately reflect the ground truth, offering a significant improvement for latent dynamics inference.">

These experiments can be interpreted using lattice-based random walk models to provide insight into underlying biological mechanisms, and continuum limit partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions of the stochastic models can be used to efficiently explore model properties instead of relying on repeated stochastic simulations. Working with efficient PDE models is of high interest for parameter estimation algorithms that typically require a large number of forward model simulations. Quantitative data from cell biology experiments usually involves non-negative cell counts in different regions of the experimental images, and it is not obvious how to relate finite, noisy count data to the solutions of continuous PDE models that correspond to noise-free density profiles. In this work we illustrate how to develop and implement likelihood-based methods for parameter estimation, parameter identifiability and model prediction for lattice-based models describing collective migration with an arbitrary number of interacting subpopulations. We implement a standard additive Gaussian measurement error model as well as a new physically-motivated multinomial measurement error model that relates noisy count data with the solution of continuous PDE models. Both measurement error models lead to similar outcomes for parameter estimation and parameter identifiability, whereas the standard additive Gaussian measurement error model leads to non-physical prediction outcomes. In contrast, the new multinomial measurement error model involves a lower computational overhead for parameter estimation and identifiability analysis, as well as leading to physically meaningful model predictions.">

        <tr id="BACKGROUND
Machine learning has advanced medical event prediction, mostly using private data. The public MIMIC-3 (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) data set, which contains detailed data on over 40,000 intensive care unit patients, stands out as it can help develop better models including structured and textual data.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to build and test a machine learning model using the MIMIC-3 data set to determine the effectiveness of information extracted from electronic medical record text using a named entity recognition, specifically QuickUMLS, for predicting important medical events. Using the prediction of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacterial infections as an example, this study shows how open data sources and simple technology can be useful for making clinically meaningful predictions.


METHODS
The MIMIC-3 data set, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory results, and textual data, such as discharge summaries, was used. This study specifically targeted patients diagnosed with Klebsiella pneumoniae or Escherichia coli infection. Predictions were based on ESBL-producing bacterial standards and the minimum inhibitory concentration criteria. Both the structured data and extracted patient histories were used as predictors. In total, 2 models, an L1-regularized logistic regression model and a LightGBM model, were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) and the precision-recall curve area under the curve (PR-AUC).


RESULTS
Of 46,520 MIMIC-3 patients, 4046 were identified with bacterial cultures, indicating the presence of K pneumoniae or E coli. After excluding patients who lacked discharge summary text, 3614 patients remained. The L1-penalized model, with variables from only the structured data, displayed a ROC-AUC of 0.646 and a PR-AUC of 0.307. The LightGBM model, combining structured and textual data, achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.707 and a PR-AUC of 0.369. Key contributors to the LightGBM model included patient age, duration since hospital admission, and specific medical history such as diabetes. The structured data-based model showed improved performance compared to the reference models. Performance was further improved when textual medical history was included. Compared to other models predicting drug-resistant bacteria, the results of this study ranked in the middle. Some misidentifications, potentially due to the limitations of QuickUMLS, may have affected the accuracy of the model.


CONCLUSIONS
This study successfully developed a predictive model for ESBL-producing bacterial infections using the MIMIC-3 data set, yielding results consistent with existing literature. This model stands out for its transparency and reliance on open data and open-named entity recognition technology. The performance of the model was enhanced using textual information. With advancements in natural language processing tools such as BERT and GPT, the extraction of medical data from text holds substantial potential for future model optimization.">

Machine learning (ML) has been harnessed as a promising modelling tool for materials research. However, small data, or data scarcity, is a bottleneck when incorporating ML in studies involving experimentation. Current experiment planning methods show several disadvantages: one‐factor‐at‐a‐time (OFAT) experimentation became impractical due to limited laboratory resources; conventional design of experiments (DoE) failed to incorporate high‐dimensional features in ML; Surrogate‐based or Bayesian optimization (BO) shifted the goal to optimize material properties rather than guiding training data accumulation. The present research proposes leveraging active learning (AL) to strategically select critical data for experimentation. Two AL strategies, query‐by‐Committee (QBC) algorithm and Greedy method, are benchmarked against random query baseline on various materials datasets. AL is shown to efficiently reduce model prediction errors with minimal additional experiment data. Investigation of hyperparameters revealed benefits of applying AL at an early stage of experimental dataset construction. Moreover, AL is implemented and validated for an in‐house materials development task ‐ electrospray modelling. AL exploration as a paradigm is highlighted to guide experiment design for efficient data accumulation purposes, and its potential for further ML modelling. In doing so, the power of ML is expected to be fully unleashed to experimental researchers.">

        <tr id="We study the problem of network regression, where one is interested in how the topology of a network changes as a function of Euclidean covariates. We build upon recent developments in generalized regression models on metric spaces based on Fr\'echet means and propose a network regression method using the Wasserstein metric. We show that when representing graphs as multivariate Gaussian distributions, the network regression problem requires the computation of a Riemannian center of mass (i.e., Fr\'echet means). Fr\'echet means with non-negative weights translates into a barycenter problem and can be efficiently computed using fixed point iterations. Although the convergence guarantees of fixed-point iterations for the computation of Wasserstein affine averages remain an open problem, we provide evidence of convergence in a large number of synthetic and real-data scenarios. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed approach improves existing procedures by accurately accounting for graph size, topology, and sparsity in synthetic experiments. Additionally, real-world experiments using the proposed approach result in higher Coefficient of Determination ($R^{2}$) values and lower mean squared prediction error (MSPE), cementing improved prediction capabilities in practice.">

These experiments, leveraging advanced classification and clustering algorithms, allow for a deep dive into the cellular processes. However, while these approaches effectively identify patterns and trends within data, they often need to improve in elucidating the causal mechanisms behind these changes. Building on this foundation, our study introduces a novel algorithm for temporal causal signaling modeling, integrating established knowledge networks with sequential gene expression data to elucidate signal transduction pathways over time. Focusing on Escherichia coli’s (E. coli) aerobic to anaerobic transition (AAT), this research marks a significant leap in understanding the organism’s metabolic shifts. By applying our algorithm to a comprehensive E. coli regulatory network and a time-series microarray dataset, we constructed the cross-time point core signaling and regulatory processes of E. coli’s AAT. Through gene expression analysis, we validated the primary regulatory interactions governing this process. We identified a novel regulatory scheme wherein environmentally responsive genes, soxR and oxyR, activate fur, modulating the nitrogen metabolism regulators fnr and nac. This regulatory cascade controls the stress regulators ompR and lrhA, ultimately affecting the cell motility gene flhD, unveiling a novel regulatory axis that elucidates the complex regulatory dynamics during the AAT process. Our approach, merging empirical data with prior knowledge, represents a significant advance in modeling cellular signaling processes, offering a deeper understanding of microbial physiology and its applications in biotechnology.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we propose Varying Effects Regression with Graph Estimation (VERGE), a novel Bayesian method for feature selection in regression. Our model has key aspects that allow it to leverage the complex structure of data sets arising from genomics or imaging studies. We distinguish between the predictors, which are the features utilized in the outcome prediction model, and the subject-level covariates, which modulate the effects of the predictors on the outcome. We construct a varying coefficients modeling framework where we infer a network among the predictor variables and utilize this network information to encourage the selection of related predictors. We employ variable selection spike-and-slab priors that enable the selection of both network-linked predictor variables and covariates that modify the predictor effects. We demonstrate through simulation studies that our method outperforms existing alternative methods in terms of both feature selection and predictive accuracy. We illustrate VERGE with an application to characterizing the influence of gut microbiome features on obesity, where we identify a set of microbial taxa and their ecological dependence relations. We allow subject-level covariates including sex and dietary intake variables to modify the coefficients of the microbiome predictors, providing additional insight into the interplay between these factors.">

        <tr id="Single domain generalization (Single-DG) intends to develop a generalizable model with only one single training domain to perform well on other unknown target domains. Under the domain-hungry configuration, how to expand the coverage of source domain and find intrinsic causal features across different distributions is the key to enhancing the models' generalization ability. Existing methods mainly depend on the meticulous design of finite image-level transformation techniques and learning invariant features across domains based on statistical correlation between samples and labels in source domain. This makes it difficult to capture stable semantics between source and target domains, which hinders the improvement of the model's generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a novel causality-inspired latent feature augmentation method for Single-DG by learning the meta-knowledge of feature-level transformation based on causal learning and interventions. Instead of strongly relying on the finite image-level transformation, with the learned meta-knowledge, we can generate diverse implicit feature-level transformations in latent space based on the consistency of causal features and diversity of non-causal features, which can better compensate for the domain-hungry defect and reduce the strong reliance on initial finite image-level transformations and capture more stable domain-invariant causal features for generalization. Extensive experiments on several open-access benchmarks demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model over other state-of-the-art single domain generalization and also multi-source domain generalization methods.">

However, empirical studies have revealed discrepancies between observed biological network data and ideal power-law fits, highlighting the need for improved modeling approaches.

Specifically, we introduce the compounded Burr (CBurr) distribution, derived from a continuous probability distribution family, enabling flexible and efficient modeling of node degree distributions in biological networks. This study comprehensively investigates the general properties of the CBurr distribution, focusing on parameter estimation using the maximum likelihood method. Subsequently, we apply the CBurr distribution model to large-scale biological network data, aiming to evaluate its efficacy in fitting the entire range of node degree distributions, surpassing conventional power-law distributions and other benchmarks. Through extensive data analysis and graphical illustrations, we demonstrate that the CBurr distribution exhibits superior modeling capabilities compared to traditional power-law distributions. This novel distribution model holds great promise for accurately capturing the complex nature of biological networks and advancing our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.">

Elucidating the expression and abundance of each of the encompassed cells is key to disease understanding and precision medicine approaches. A first step in any such deconvolution is the inference of cell type abundances in the given mixture. Numerous approaches to cell-type deconvolution have been proposed, yet very few take advantage of the emerging discipline of deep learning and most approaches are limited to input data regarding the expression profiles of the cell types in question. Here we present DECODE, a deep learning method for the task that is data-driven and does not depend on input expression profiles. DECODE builds on a deep unfolded non-negative matrix factorization technique. It is shown to outperform previous approaches on a range of synthetic and real data sets, producing abundance estimates that are closer to and better correlated with the real values.">

Their ability to adopt various conformational states, which influence their function, makes them crucial in pharmacoproteomic studies.

In this context, computational modeling, particularly molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, may offer valuable insights into the dynamics and energetics of GPCR transformations, especially when combined with machine learning (ML) methods and techniques for achieving model interpretability for knowledge generation. The current study builds upon previous work in which the layer relevance propagation (LRP) technique was employed to interpret the predictions in a multi-class classification problem concerning the conformational states of the β2-adrenergic (β2AR) receptor from MD simulations. Here, we address the challenges posed by class imbalance and extend previous analyses by evaluating the robustness and stability of deep learning (DL)-based predictions under different imbalance mitigation techniques.

Current statistical analysis on biological modules predominantly focuses on either detecting the functional modules in biological networks or sub-group regression on the biological features without using the network data. This paper proposes a novel network-based neighborhood regression framework whose regression functions depend on both the global community-level information and local connectivity structures among entities. An efficient community-wise least square optimization approach is developed to uncover the strength of regulation among the network modules while enabling asymptotic inference. With random graph theory, we derive non-asymptotic estimation error bounds for the proposed estimator, achieving exact minimax optimality. Unlike the root-n consistency typical in canonical linear regression, our model exhibits linear consistency in the number of nodes n, highlighting the advantage of incorporating neighborhood information. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is further supported by extensive numerical experiments. Application to whole-exome sequencing and RNA-sequencing Autism datasets demonstrates the usage of the proposed method in identifying the association between the gene modules of genetic variations and the gene modules of genomic differential expressions.">

Large-scale motions may govern protein structure–function relationship, and numerous transient but stable conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) can play a crucial role in biological function.

In this paper first an unsupervised deep learning-based model, termed Internal Coordinate Net (ICoN), is developed that learns the physical principles of conformational changes from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Second, interpolating data points in the learned latent space are selected that rapidly identify novel synthetic conformations with sophisticated and large-scale sidechains and backbone arrangements. Third, with the highly dynamic amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ42) monomer, our deep learning model provided a comprehensive sampling of Aβ42’s conformational landscape. Analysis of these synthetic conformations revealed conformational clusters that can be used to rationalize experimental findings. Additionally, the method can identify novel conformations with important interactions in atomistic details that are not included in the training data. New synthetic conformations showed distinct sidechain rearrangements that are probed by our EPR and amino acid substitution studies. The proposed approach is highly transferable and can be used for any available data for training. The work also demonstrated the ability for deep learning to utilize learned natural atomistic motions in protein conformation sampling.">

        <tr id="The rise of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and evolved computational algorithms have significantly advanced biomedical science by revealing and visualizing the multifaceted and diverse nature of single cells. These technical advancements have also highlighted the pivotal role of cell clusters as representations of biologically universal entities such as cell types and cell states. However, to some extent, these clusterings remain dataset-specific and method-dependent. To improve comparability across different datasets or compositions, we previously introduced a graph-based representation of cell collections that captures the statistical dependencies of their characteristic genes. While our earlier work focused on theoretical insights, it was not sufficiently adapted and fine-tuned for practical implementation. To address this, the present paper introduces an improved practice to define and evaluate cellular identities based on our theory. First, we provide a concise summary of our previous theory and workflow. Then, point-by-point, we highlight the issues that needed fixing and propose solutions. The framework’s utility was enhanced by leveraging alternative formats of cellular features such as gene ontology (GO) terms and effectively handling dropouts. Supplemental techniques are offered to reinforce the versatility and robustness of our method.">

As a result, these algorithms may search an unnecessarily large space and discover equations that are less accurate or overly complex. In this paper, we propose to leverage symmetry in automated equation discovery to compress the equation search space and improve the accuracy and simplicity of the learned equations. Specifically, we derive equivariance constraints from the time-independent symmetries of ODEs. Depending on the types of symmetries, we develop a pipeline for incorporating symmetry constraints into various equation discovery algorithms, including sparse regression and genetic programming. In experiments across a diverse range of dynamical systems, our approach demonstrates better robustness against noise and recovers governing equations with significantly higher probability than baselines without symmetry.">

        <tr id="Machine learned potentials are becoming a popular tool to define an effective energy model for complex systems, either incorporating electronic structure effects at the atomistic resolution, or effectively renormalizing part of the atomistic degrees of freedom at a coarse-grained resolution. One of the main criticisms to machine learned potentials is that the energy inferred by the network is not as interpretable as in more traditional approaches where a simpler functional form is used. Here we address this problem by extending tools recently proposed in the nascent field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to coarse-grained potentials based on graph neural networks (GNN). We demonstrate the approach on three different coarse-grained systems including two fluids (methane and water) and the protein NTL9. On these examples, we show that the neural network potentials can be in practice decomposed in relevance contributions to different orders, that can be directly interpreted and provide physical insights on the systems of interest.">

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

        <tr id="5065 Background: Overall survival (OS) remains the gold standard endpoint for clinical trials in metastatic prostate cancer (metPC) yet requires extensive follow-up. We sought to develop a model utilizing short term (≤ 4 months) prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetic data to predict the OS readout from phase 3 clinical trials, with the goal of accelerating readout time of trials for patients (pts) with metPC. Methods: Clinical and PSA data were obtained from 7 metPC trials: 6 randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials (TITAN, COU-AA-301, COU-AA-302, LATITUDE, ACIS, and MAGNITUDE), and one multicenter, phase II trial (GALAHAD). We developed 18 PSA kinetic variables from the first 4 months of enrollment including: 50% decline in PSA (PSA50), 90% decline in PSA, PSA=0.1, and PSA=0.2 within 1, 2, 3, and 4 months; and slope and base of the exponential fit of PSA over the first 4 months on study). To balance pt and disease characteristics, TITAN, COU-AA-301, and ACIS were used to train the intermediate endpoint, with remaining studies held out as an external testing cohort. A random 60/40% split of the pooled pt-level data was performed as a sensitivity analysis. Adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (aLASSO)-based Cox proportional hazards models were applied to select previously identified prognostic baseline clinical variables with and without PSA kinetic variables most predictive of OS on five-fold cross validation. Performance with and without PSA kinetics was assessed using C-index, integrated Brier score (IBS), and time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (tAUC) at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Results: The study included 6,451 pts with median follow-up of 22 months and 85,785 PSA values. aLASSO selected Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, disease extent, lactate dehydrogenase, albumin, hemoglobin, PSA, and alkaline phosphatase as baseline variables for the prognostic comparator model. In the model including PSA kinetics, aLASSO identified PSA50 at 4 months, PSA0.1 at 1 month, and PSA slope as kinetics providing additional intra-treatment information to improve prediction of OS. The model with PSA kinetics showed improved performance on the test trials: C-index (0.72 vs. 0.66), IBS (0.158 vs. 0.173), and tAUC (0.84, 0.78, 0.78, and 0.76 vs. 0.78, 0.71, 0.69, and 0.65 at times 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively; p < 0.05.) Sensitivity analysis using a random split of the pooled pt-level data supported the importance of PSA50 at 4 months and PSA slope. Conclusions: Data from 6,451 mPC pts enrolled on prospective clinical trials were used to develop a machine learning model which included kinetic PSA data and predicted the long-term OS readout in Phase 3 trials with just the first four months of data. This model will be validated in independent data sets comprised of other completed phase 3 trials.">

In this dissertation, we explore high-dimensional problems related to physiological monitoring using latent variable models. First, we present a novel deep state-space model to generate electrical waveforms of the heart using optically obtained signals as inputs. This can bring about clinical diagnoses of heart disease via simple assessment through wearable devices. Second, we present a brain signal modeling scheme that combines the strengths of probabilistic graphical models and deep adversarial learning. The structured representations can provide interpretability and encode inductive biases to reduce the data complexity of neural oscillations. The efficacy of the learned representations is further studied in epilepsy seizure detection formulated as an unsupervised learning problem. Third, we propose a framework for the joint modeling of physiological measures and behavior. Existing methods to combine multiple sources of brain data provided are limited. Direct analysis of the relationship between different types of physiological measures usually does not involve behavioral data. Our method can identify the unique and shared contributions of brain regions to behavior and can be used to discover new functions of brain regions. The success of these innovative computational methods would allow the translation of biomarker findings across species and provide insight into neurocognitive analysis in numerous biological studies and clinical diagnoses, as well as emerging consumer applications.">

        <tr id="PURPOSE
Early prediction of response to immunotherapy may help guide patient management by identifying resistance to treatment and allowing adaptation of therapies. This analysis evaluated a mathematical model of response to immunotherapy that provides patient-specific prediction of outcome using the initial change in tumor size/burden from baseline to the first follow-up visit on standard imaging scans.


METHODS
We applied the model to 600 patients with advanced solid tumors who received durvalumab in Study 1108, a phase I/II trial, and compared outcome prediction performance versus size-based criteria with RECIST version 1.1 best overall response (BOR), baseline circulating tumor (ct)DNA level, and other clinical/pathologic predictors of immunotherapy response.


RESULTS
In multiple solid tumors, the mathematical parameter representing net tumor growth rate at the first on-treatment computed tomography (CT) scan assessed around 6 weeks after starting durvalumab (α1) had a concordance index to predict overall survival (OS) of 0.66-0.77 on multivariate analyses. This measurement of early tumor dynamics significantly improved multivariate OS models that included standard RECIST v1.1 criteria, baseline ctDNA levels, and other clinical/pathologic factors in predicting OS. Furthermore, α1 was assessed consistently at the first on-treatment CT scan, whereas all traditional RECIST BOR groups were confirmed only after this time.


CONCLUSION
These results support further exploring α1 as an integral biomarker of response to immunotherapy. This biomarker may be predictive of further benefit and can be assessed before RECIST response groups can be assigned, potentially providing an opportunity to personalize oncologic management.">

As it is known, the cell cycle is regarded as a confounder when analyzing other factors in single-cell RNA-seq data, but it is not clear how it will work on the integrated single-cell multi-omics data. Here, a cell cycle-aware network (CCAN) is developed to remove cell cycle effects from the integrated single-cell multi-omics data while keeping the cell type-specific variations. This is the first computational model to study the cell-cycle effects in the integration of single-cell multi-omics data. Validations on several benchmark datasets show the outstanding performance of CCAN in a variety of downstream analyses and applications, including removing cell cycle effects and batch effects of scRNA-seq datasets from different protocols, integrating paired and unpaired scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, accurately transferring cell type labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq data, and characterizing the differentiation process from hematopoietic stem cells to different lineages in the integration of differentiation data.">

        <tr id="Multimodal survival methods combining gigapixel histology whole-slide images (WSIs) and transcriptomic profiles are particularly promising for patient prognostication and stratification. Current approaches involve tokenizing the WSIs into smaller patches (>10,000 patches) and transcriptomics into gene groups, which are then integrated using a Transformer for predicting outcomes. However, this process generates many tokens, which leads to high memory requirements for computing attention and complicates post-hoc interpretability analyses. Instead, we hypothesize that we can: (1) effectively summarize the morphological content of a WSI by condensing its constituting tokens using morphological prototypes, achieving more than 300x compression; and (2) accurately characterize cellular functions by encoding the transcriptomic profile with biological pathway prototypes, all in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting multimodal tokens are then processed by a fusion network, either with a Transformer or an optimal transport cross-alignment, which now operates with a small and fixed number of tokens without approximations. Extensive evaluation on six cancer types shows that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods with much less computation while unlocking new interpretability analyses.">

JKOnet* minimizes a simple quadratic loss, runs at lightspeed, and drastically outperforms other baselines in practice. Additionally, JKOnet* provides a closed-form optimal solution for linearly parametrized functionals.

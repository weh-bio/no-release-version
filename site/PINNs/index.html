In this two part treatise, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct classes of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-efficient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this first part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial differential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully differentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.">

In this second part of our two-part treatise, we focus on the problem of data-driven discovery of partial differential equations.

The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated using a wide range of benchmark problems in mathematical physics, including conservation laws, incompressible fluid flow, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.">

        <tr id="The process of transforming observed data into predictive mathematical models of the physical world has always been paramount in science and engineering. Although data is currently being collected at an ever-increasing pace, devising meaningful models out of such observations in an automated fashion still remains an open problem. In this work, we put forth a machine learning approach for identifying nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Specifically, we blend classical tools from numerical analysis, namely the multi-step time-stepping schemes, with powerful nonlinear function approximators, namely deep neural networks, to distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given data-set. We test the effectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems involving the identification of complex, nonlinear and chaotic dynamics, and we demonstrate how this allows us to accurately learn the dynamics, forecast future states, and identify basins of attraction. In particular, we study the Lorenz system, the fluid flow behind a cylinder, the Hopf bifurcation, and the Glycoltic oscillator model as an example of complicated nonlinear dynamics typical of biological systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical models of biological reactions at the system-level lead to a set of ordinary differential equations with many unknown parameters that need to be inferred using relatively few experimental measurements. Having a reliable and robust algorithm for parameter inference and prediction of the hidden dynamics has been one of the core subjects in systems biology, and is the focus of this study. We have developed a new systems-biology-informed deep learning algorithm that incorporates the system of ordinary differential equations into the neural networks. Enforcing these equations effectively adds constraints to the optimization procedure that manifests itself as an imposed structure on the observational data. Using few scattered and noisy measurements, we are able to infer the dynamics of unobserved species, external forcing, and the unknown model parameters. We have successfully tested the algorithm for three different benchmark problems. Author summary The dynamics of systems biological processes are usually modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which introduce various unknown parameters that need to be estimated efficiently from noisy measurements of concentration for a few species only. In this work, we present a new “systems-informed neural network” to infer the dynamics of experimentally unobserved species as well as the unknown parameters in the system of equations. By incorporating the system of ODEs into the neural networks, we effectively add constraints to the optimization algorithm, which makes the method robust to noisy and sparse measurements.">

        <tr id="We propose a randomized physics-informed neural network (PINN) or rPINN method for uncertainty quantification in inverse partial differential equation (PDE) problems with noisy data. This method is used to quantify uncertainty in the inverse PDE PINN solutions. Recently, the Bayesian PINN (BPINN) method was proposed, where the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters was formulated using the Bayes' theorem and sampled using approximate inference methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variational inference (VI) methods. In this work, we demonstrate that HMC fails to converge for non-linear inverse PDE problems. As an alternative to HMC, we sample the distribution by solving the stochastic optimization problem obtained by randomizing the PINN loss function. The effectiveness of the rPINN method is tested for linear and non-linear Poisson equations, and the diffusion equation with a high-dimensional space-dependent diffusion coefficient. The rPINN method provides informative distributions for all considered problems. For the linear Poisson equation, HMC and rPINN produce similar distributions, but rPINN is on average 27 times faster than HMC. For the non-linear Poison and diffusion equations, the HMC method fails to converge because a single HMC chain cannot sample multiple modes of the posterior distribution of the PINN parameters in a reasonable amount of time.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a significant advancement in scientific machine learning by integrating fundamental physical laws into their architecture through loss functions. PINNs have been successfully applied to solve various forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a notable challenge can emerge during the early training stages when solving inverse problems. Specifically, data losses remain high while PDE residual losses are minimized rapidly, thereby exacerbating the imbalance between loss terms and impeding the overall efficiency of PINNs. To address this challenge, this study proposes a novel framework termed data-guided physics-informed neural networks (DG-PINNs). The DG-PINNs framework is structured into two distinct phases: a pre-training phase and a fine-tuning phase. In the pre-training phase, a loss function with only the data loss is minimized in a neural network. In the fine-tuning phase, a composite loss function, which consists of the data loss, PDE residual loss, and, if available, initial and boundary condition losses, is minimized in the same neural network. Notably, the pre-training phase ensures that the data loss is already at a low value before the fine-tuning phase commences. This approach enables the fine-tuning phase to converge to a minimal composite loss function with fewer iterations compared to existing PINNs. To validate the effectiveness, noise-robustness, and efficiency of DG-PINNs, extensive numerical investigations are conducted on inverse problems related to several classical PDEs, including the heat equation, wave equation, Euler--Bernoulli beam equation, and Navier--Stokes equation. The numerical results demonstrate that DG-PINNs can accurately solve these inverse problems and exhibit robustness against noise in training data.">

In particular, we compare them with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets), which are based on the standard MLP representation. We find that although the original KANs based on the B-splines parameterization lack accuracy and efficiency, modified versions based on low-order orthogonal polynomials have comparable performance to PINNs and DeepONet although they still lack robustness as they may diverge for different random seeds or higher order orthogonal polynomials. We visualize their corresponding loss landscapes and analyze their learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory. Our study follows the FAIR principles so that other researchers can use our benchmarks to further advance this emerging topic.">

This work applies KANs as the backbone of a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework, generalizing their use to the time-dependent and temporal grid-sensitive cases often seen in dynamical systems and scientific machine learning applications. The proposed KAN-ODEs retain the flexible dynamical system modeling framework of Neural ODEs while leveraging the many benefits of KANs compared to MLPs, including higher accuracy and faster neural scaling, stronger interpretability and generalizability, and lower parameter counts. First, we quantitatively demonstrated these improvements in a comprehensive study of the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model. We then showcased the KAN-ODE framework's ability to learn symbolic source terms and complete solution profiles in higher-complexity and data-lean scenarios including wave propagation and shock formation, the complex Schr\"odinger equation, and the Allen-Cahn phase separation equation. The successful training of KAN-ODEs, and their improved performance compared to traditional Neural ODEs, implies significant potential in leveraging this novel network architecture in myriad scientific machine learning applications for discovering hidden physics and predicting dynamic evolution.">

        <tr id="Wildland fires pose terrifying natural hazards, underscoring the urgent need to develop data-driven and physics-informed digital twins for wildfire prevention, monitoring, intervention, and response. In this direction of research, this work introduces a physics-informed neural network (PiNN) to learn the unknown parameters of an interpretable wildfire spreading model. The considered wildfire spreading model integrates fundamental physical laws articulated by key model parameters, essential for capturing the complex behavior of wildfires. The proposed machine learning approach leverages the theory of artificial neural networks with the physical constraints governing wildfire dynamics, such as the first principles of mass and energy conservation. Training of the PiNN for physics-informed parameter identification is realized using data of the temporal evolution of one- and two-dimensional (plane surface) fire fronts that have been obtained from a high-fidelity simulator of the wildfire spreading model under consideration. The parameter learning results demonstrate the remarkable predictive ability of the proposed PiNN in uncovering the unknown coefficients in both the one- and two-dimensional fire spreading scenarios. Additionally, this methodology exhibits robustness by identifying the same parameters in the presence of noisy data. The proposed framework is envisioned to be incorporated in a physics-informed digital twin for intelligent wildfire management and risk assessment.">

        <tr id="Physics informed neural networks have been gaining popularity due to their unique ability to incorporate physics laws into data-driven models, ensuring that the predictions are not only consistent with empirical data but also align with domain-specific knowledge in the form of physics equations. The integration of physics principles enables the method to require less data while maintaining the robustness of deep learning in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs.

        <tr id="Deep learning with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has emerged as a highly popular and effective approach for solving partial differential equations(PDEs). In this paper, we first investigate the extrapolation capability of the PINN method for time-dependent PDEs. Taking advantage of this extrapolation property, we can generalize the training result obtained in the time subinterval to the large interval by adding a correction term to the network parameters of the subinterval. The correction term is determined by further training with the sample points in the added subinterval. Secondly, by designing an extrapolation control function with special characteristics and combining it with the correction term, we construct a new neural network architecture whose network parameters are coupled with the time variable, which we call the extrapolation-driven network architecture. Based on this architecture, using a single neural network, we can obtain the overall PINN solution of the whole domain with the following two characteristics: (1) it completely inherits the local solution of the interval obtained from the previous training, (2) at the interval node, it strictly maintains the continuity and smoothness that the true solution has. The extrapolation-driven network architecture allows us to divide a large time domain into multiple subintervals and solve the time-dependent PDEs one by one in chronological order. This training scheme respects the causality principle and effectively overcomes the difficulties of the conventional PINN method in solving the evolution equation on a large time domain. Numerical experiments verify the performance of our proposed method.">

Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics.

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

        <tr id="Structural damage detection is an inverse problem to identify and quantify structural damage from measurement data by discovering the variation of structural mechanical parameters. Recently, a novel deep learning framework named physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) has been proposed and successfully applied to solve inverse problems of various linear/nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating physical information such as governing equations as prior information. In this study, we propose a PINN-based framework to exploit a novel method of structural damage detection. Specifically, a deep neural network model as the core of PINNs is built to predict the dynamic response in different degrees of freedom. The unknown mechanical parameters are initialized randomly and updated together with the neural network model parameters. Then, the structural physics model is embedded by calculating the residuals of governing equations as parts of the loss function. The residual between the predicted dynamic response and measurement data is also used as another part of the loss function. A two-step optimization strategy is proposed to obtain the best unknown parameter values that can fit the measurement data and governing equations simultaneously. Through numerical experiments of a single-degree-of-freedom system, we demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully identify potential structural mechanical parameters and quantitatively detect structural damage. The influence of sparsity and noise in the measurement data on the detection results is also analysed.">

Different from traditional neural networks for solving partial differential equations, the proposed method uses a deep neural operator network to indirectly construct the mapping relationship between the variable functions and solution functions. This approach makes full use of the hidden information between the variable functions and independent variables. The process whereby the model captures incredibly complex and highly nonlinear relationships is simplified, thereby making network learning easier and enhancing the extraction of information about the independent variables in partial differential systems.

        <tr id="Phase-field models have been widely used to investigate the phase transformation phenomena. However, it is difficult to solve the problems numerically due to their strong nonlinearities and higher-order terms. This work is devoted to solving forward and inverse problems of the phase-field models by a novel deep learning framework named Phase-Field Weak-form Neural Networks (PFWNN), which is based on the weak forms of the phase-field equations. In this framework, the weak solutions are parameterized as deep neural networks with a periodic layer, while the test function space is constructed by functions compactly supported in small regions. The PFWNN can efficiently solve the phase-field equations characterizing the sharp transitions and identify the important parameters by employing the weak forms. It also allows local training in small regions, which significantly reduce the computational cost. Moreover, it can guarantee the residual descending along the time marching direction, enhancing the convergence of the method. Numerical examples are presented for several benchmark problems. The results validate the efficiency and accuracy of the PFWNN. This work also sheds light on solving the forward and inverse problems of general high-order time-dependent partial differential equations.">

        <tr id="Simulating spatiotemporal turbulence with high fidelity remains a cornerstone challenge in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to its intricate multiscale nature and prohibitive computational demands. Traditional approaches typically employ closure models, which attempt to represent small-scale features in an unresolved manner. However, these methods often sacrifice accuracy and lose high-frequency/wavenumber information, especially in scenarios involving complex flow physics. In this paper, we introduce an innovative neural differentiable modeling framework designed to enhance the predictability and efficiency of spatiotemporal turbulence simulations. Our approach features differentiable hybrid modeling techniques that seamlessly integrate deep neural networks with numerical PDE solvers within a differentiable programming framework, synergizing deep learning with physics-based CFD modeling. Specifically, a hybrid differentiable neural solver is constructed on a coarser grid to capture large-scale turbulent phenomena, followed by the application of a Bayesian conditional diffusion model that generates small-scale turbulence conditioned on large-scale flow predictions. Two innovative hybrid architecture designs are studied, and their performance is evaluated through comparative analysis against conventional large eddy simulation techniques with physics-based subgrid-scale closures and purely data-driven neural solvers. The findings underscore the potential of the neural differentiable modeling framework to significantly enhance the accuracy and computational efficiency of turbulence simulations. This study not only demonstrates the efficacy of merging deep learning with physics-based numerical solvers but also sets a new precedent for advanced CFD modeling techniques, highlighting the transformative impact of differentiable programming in scientific computing.">

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

        <tr id="Given the existence of various forward and inverse problems in combustion studies and applications that necessitate distinct methods for resolution, a framework to solve them in a unified way is critically needed. A promising approach is the integration of machine learning methods with governing equations of combustion systems, which exhibits superior generality and few-shot learning ability compared to purely data-driven methods. In this work, the FlamePINN-1D framework is proposed to solve the forward and inverse problems of 1D laminar flames based on physics-informed neural networks. Three cases with increasing complexity have been tested: Case 1 are freely-propagating premixed (FPP) flames with simplified physical models, while Case 2 and Case 3 are FPP and counterflow premixed (CFP) flames with detailed models, respectively. For forward problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to solve the flame fields and infer the unknown eigenvalues (such as laminar flame speeds) under the constraints of governing equations and boundary conditions. For inverse problems, FlamePINN-1D aims to reconstruct the continuous fields and infer the unknown parameters (such as transport and chemical kinetics parameters) from noisy sparse observations of the flame. Our results strongly validate these capabilities of FlamePINN-1D across various flames and working conditions. Compared to traditional methods, FlamePINN-1D is differentiable and mesh-free, exhibits no discretization errors, and is easier to implement for inverse problems. The inverse problem results also indicate the possibility of optimizing chemical mechanisms from measurements of laboratory 1D flames. Furthermore, some proposed strategies, such as hard constraints and thin-layer normalization, are proven to be essential for the robust learning of FlamePINN-1D.

We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly.

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

Their main benefit is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to standard neural networks. These attributes are particularly desirable in the field of computer-aided design, where there is often the need to replace computationally expensive, physics-based models with fast running approximations, known as surrogate models or meta-models. Since a surrogate emulates the original model accurately in near-real time, it yields a speed benefit that can be used to carry out orders of magnitude more function calls quickly. However, in the special case of gradient-enhanced methods, there is the additional value proposition that partial derivatives are accurate, which is a critical property for one important use-case: surrogate-based optimization. This work derives the complete theory and exemplifies its superiority over standard neural nets for surrogate-based optimization.">

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries. These results highlight the unique generalization capability of the proposed operator learning approach.">

This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages.

We propose an easy-to-apply heuristic to assess whether estimation of such states may be possible. As numerical examples, we consider a continuously stirred tank reactor and a liquid-liquid separator. We find that PINNs can infer unmeasured states with reasonable accuracy, and they generalize better in low-data scenarios than purely data-driven models. We thus show that PINNs are capable of modeling processes when relatively few experimental data and only partially known mechanistic descriptions are available, and conclude that they constitute a promising avenue that warrants further investigation.">

Training these models is classically a data-fitting task, but knowledge of the expression of the differential equation can be used to supplement the training objective, leading to the development of physics-informed scientific machine learning. In this article, we focus on one class of models called nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Motivated by connections to numerical integration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the physics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the underlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction.

This method avoids the need to solve non-sparse linear systems, making it convenient for algorithm implementation and solving high-dimensional problems. The unique sampling method and neuron architecture significantly enhance the training efficiency and accuracy of the neural network.

        <tr id="In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of deep operator networks (DeepONets) in solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on unknown manifolds. By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.">

However, solving inverse problems involving fractional derivatives presents notable challenges, including issues related to stability and uniqueness. While Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as effective tools for solving inverse problems, most existing PINN frameworks primarily focus on integer-ordered derivatives. In this study, we extend the application of PINNs to address inverse problems involving time-fractional derivatives, specifically targeting two problems: 1) anomalous diffusion and 2) fractional viscoelastic constitutive equation. Leveraging both numerically generated datasets and experimental data, we calibrate the concentration-dependent generalized diffusion coefficient and parameters for the fractional Maxwell model. We devise a tailored residual loss function that scales with the standard deviation of observed data. We rigorously test our framework's efficacy in handling anomalous diffusion. Even after introducing 25% Gaussian noise to the concentration dataset, our framework demonstrates remarkable robustness. Notably, the relative error in predicting the generalized diffusion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative is less than 10% for all cases, underscoring the resilience and accuracy of our approach. In another test case, we predict relaxation moduli for three pig tissue samples, consistently achieving relative errors below 10%. Furthermore, our framework exhibits promise in modeling anomalous diffusion and non-linear fractional viscoelasticity.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors.

The forward modeling of the elastic wave equation in the time domain by the staggered-grid difference schemes can be reformulated as a process of a recurrent neural network (RNN). As a result, the FWI problem is equivalent to neural network training, and the parameter of RNN coincides with the model parameter of inversion. Furthermore, a variety of stochastic optimizers including Adgrad, RMSprop, Adam, Nadam and Admax in neural networks can be applied in the training process. The gradient of the objective function with the model parameters is computed by the technique of automatic differentiation instead of the adjoint-state method in the traditional FWI. A new objective function of FWI is also proposed. Compared to the traditional FWI methods, the developed FWI using tools of neural networks has a relatively good robustness. Numerical computations and comparisons with Marmousi model for two and three parameters simultaneous inversion are completed. The results show that the algorithms except Adgrad can yield good inversion results. The FWI framework developed in this paper has potential applications for other complex partial equations.">

We also introduce distributed EDNN (D-EDNN) by spatially partitioning the global domain into several elements and assigning individual EDNNs to each element to solve the local evolution of the PDE. The networks then exchange the solution and fluxes at their interfaces, similar to flux-reconstruction methods, and ensure that the PDE dynamics are accurately preserved between neighboring elements. Together C-EDNN and D-EDNN form the general class of Multi-EDNN methods. We demonstrate these methods with aid of canonical problems including linear advection, the heat equation, and the compressible Navier-Stokes equations in Couette and Taylor-Green flows.">

Inference is performed over both equation parameters and state variables using a statistically motivated likelihood function. Sparsity is enforced by a selection algorithm which iteratively removes terms and compares models using statistical information criteria. Large scale optimization is performed using a second-order variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, where the gradient and Hessian are computed via automatic differentiation. Illustrations involving canonical systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are used to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach. Accurate reconstruction of systems is found to be possible even in extreme cases of limited data and large observation noise.">

Two typical examples are the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP) system in plasma physics and the Boltzmann equation in semiconductor physics. In this paper, we propose a generic asymptotic-preserving multiple-input DeepONet (AP-MIONet) method for solving these two kinetic equations with variable parameters in the high-field regime. Our method aims to tackle two major challenges in this regime: the additional variable parameters introduced by electric fields, and the absence of an explicit local equilibrium, which is a key component of asymptotic-preserving (AP) schemes. We leverage the multiple-input DeepONet (MIONet) architecture to accommodate additional parameters, and formulate the AP loss function by incorporating both the mass conservation law and the original kinetic system. This strategy can avoid reliance on the explicit local equilibrium, preserve the mass and adapt to non-equilibrium states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method through extensive numerical examples.">

        <tr id="Fractional and tempered fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) are effective models of long-range interactions, anomalous diffusion, and non-local effects. Traditional numerical methods for these problems are mesh-based, thus struggling with the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution due to their universal approximation, generalization ability, and mesh-free training. In principle, Monte Carlo fractional PINN (MC-fPINN) estimates fractional derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and thus could lift CoD. However, this may cause significant variance and errors, hence affecting convergence; in addition, MC-fPINN is sensitive to hyperparameters. In general, numerical methods and specifically PINNs for tempered fractional PDEs are under-developed. Herein, we extend MC-fPINN to tempered fractional PDEs to address these issues, resulting in the Monte Carlo tempered fractional PINN (MC-tfPINN). To reduce possible high variance and errors from Monte Carlo sampling, we replace the one-dimensional (1D) Monte Carlo with 1D Gaussian quadrature, applicable to both MC-fPINN and MC-tfPINN. We validate our methods on various forward and inverse problems of fractional and tempered fractional PDEs, scaling up to 100,000 dimensions. Our improved MC-fPINN/MC-tfPINN using quadrature consistently outperforms the original versions in accuracy and convergence speed in very high dimensions.">

This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.">

BENN is capable of constraining not only the predicted values but also their derivatives and variances, ensuring a more robust and reliable model output. To achieve simultaneous uncertainty quantification and constraint satisfaction, we employ the method of multipliers approach. This allows for the concurrent estimation of neural network parameters and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. Our experiments, spanning diverse applications such as beam deflection modeling and microstructure generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BENN.

To aid in both stable training and enhanced accuracy over a variety of problems, we present (1) a family of orthogonality constraints that impose mutual orthogonality between the polynomial and the DNN within a PANN; (2) a simple basis pruning approach to combat the curse of dimensionality introduced by the polynomial component; and (3) an adaptation of a polynomial preconditioning strategy to both DNNs and polynomials. We test the resulting architecture for its polynomial reproduction properties, ability to approximate both smooth functions and functions of limited smoothness, and as a method for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). Through these experiments, we demonstrate that PANNs offer superior approximation properties to DNNs for both regression and the numerical solution of PDEs, while also offering enhanced accuracy over both polynomial and DNN-based regression (each) when regressing functions with limited smoothness.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict.

To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model.

In response, this study presents a novel methodology aimed at enhancing the predictive capability of PINNs for time-dependent scenarios.

The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promising potential for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning. 

However, PINNs face training difficulties for evolutionary PDEs, particularly for dynamical systems whose solutions exhibit multi-scale or turbulent behavior over time.

The reason is that PINNs may violate the temporal causality property since all the temporal features in the PINNs loss are trained simultaneously. 

This paper proposes to use implicit time differencing schemes to enforce temporal causality, and use transfer learning to sequentially update the PINNs in space as surrogates for PDE solutions in different time frames.

The evolving PINNs are better able to capture the varying complexities of the evolutionary equations, while only requiring minor updates between adjacent time frames.

Our method is theoretically proven to be convergent if the time step is small and each PINN in different time frames is well-trained.

In addition, we provide state-of-the-art (SOTA) numerical results for a variety of benchmarks for which existing PINNs formulations may fail or be inefficient.

We demonstrate that the proposed method improves the accuracy of PINNs approximation for evolutionary PDEs and improves efficiency by a factor of 4–40x.

        <tr id="We introduce a novel neural network structure called Strongly Constrained Theory-Guided Neural Network (SCTgNN), to investigate the behaviours of the localized solutions of the generalized nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation. This equation comprises four physically significant nonlinear evolution equations, namely, (i) NLS equation, Hirota equation Lakshmanan-Porsezian-Daniel (LPD) equation and fifth-order NLS equation. The generalized NLS equation demonstrates nonlinear effects up to quintic order, indicating rich and complex dynamics in various fields of physics. By combining concepts from the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory-Guided Neural Network (TgNN) models, SCTgNN aims to enhance our understanding of complex phenomena, particularly within nonlinear systems that defy conventional patterns. To begin, we employ the TgNN method to predict the behaviours of localized waves, including solitons, rogue waves, and breathers, within the generalized NLS equation. We then use SCTgNN to predict the aforementioned localized solutions and calculate the mean square errors in both SCTgNN and TgNN in predicting these three localized solutions. Our findings reveal that both models excel in understanding complex behaviours and provide predictions across a wide variety of situations.">

Traditional scientic computing relies on mathematical equations to describe and predict the scientic laws of nature, while deep learning provides a new perspective to solve complex mathematical problems by learning patterns in data. The introduction of the Physical Information Neural Network (PINN) and the Ordinary Dierential Equation (ODENet) network layer enables deep learning technology to more accurately simulate and predict scientic phenomena. This study shows that by embedding an ODE-Net network layer in a physical information neural network (PINN), the tting accuracy and generalization performance of the model can be signicantly improved. Experimental results show that compared with traditional numerical methods and fully connected neural networks, this model combined with deep learning technology not only shows higher accuracy when solving partial dierential equations, but also exhibits faster convergence speed and stronger adaptability.

        <tr id="The neutron diffusion equation plays a pivotal role in the analysis of nuclear reactors. Nevertheless, employing the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) method for its solution entails certain limitations. Traditional PINN approaches often utilize fully connected network (FCN) architecture, which is susceptible to overfitting, training instability, and gradient vanishing issues as the network depth increases. These challenges result in accuracy bottlenecks in the solution. In response to these issues, the Residual-based Resample Physics-Informed Neural Network(R2-PINN) is proposed, which proposes an improved PINN architecture that replaces the FCN with a Convolutional Neural Network with a shortcut(S-CNN), incorporating skip connections to facilitate gradient propagation between network layers. Additionally, the incorporation of the Residual Adaptive Resampling (RAR) mechanism dynamically increases sampling points, enhancing the spatial representation capabilities and overall predictive accuracy of the model. The experimental results illustrate that our approach significantly improves the model's convergence capability, achieving high-precision predictions of physical fields. In comparison to traditional FCN-based PINN methods, R2-PINN effectively overcomes the limitations inherent in current methods, providing more accurate and robust solutions for neutron diffusion equations.">

We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation. Ample numerical experiments are presented based on the proposed algorithm to validate the effectiveness of this method and confirm aspects of the theoretical analyses.">

In AdaI-PINNs, the activation functions vary solely in their slopes, which are trained along with the other parameters of the neural networks. This makes the AdaI-PINNs framework fully automated without requiring preset activation functions.

The proposed method does not need the gradients of the physical equations, although the conventional physics-informed models need the gradients. DNNs are widely used to predict phenomena in physics and mechanics. One of the issues with DNNs is that their output does not always satisfy physical equations. One approach to consider with physical equations is adding a residual of the equations into the loss function; this is called physics-informed neural network (PINN). One feature of PINNs is that the physical equations and corresponding residuals must be implemented as part of a neural network model. In addition, the residual does not always converge to a small value. The proposed model is a physics-guided generative adversarial network (PG-GAN) that uses a GAN architecture, in which physical equations are used to judge whether the neural network’s output is consistent with physics. The proposed method was applied to a simple problem to assess its potential usability.">

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model. Here, we discuss an alternative paradigm: by making the physical model auto-differentiable we can construct a neural surrogate to represent the unknown physical quantity sought, while avoiding having to relearn the known physics entirely. We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

It has been observed that DNNs are particularly well suited to weakening the effect of the curse of dimensionality, a term coined by Richard E. Bellman in the late `50s to describe challenges such as the exponential dependence of the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples required to solve an approximation problem, on the dimension of the ambient space. However, although DNNs have been used to solve PDEs since the `90s, the literature underpinning their mathematical efficiency in terms of numerical analysis (i.e., stability, accuracy, and sample complexity), is only recently beginning to emerge. In this paper, we leverage recent advancements in function approximation using sparsity-based techniques and random sampling to develop and analyze an efficient high-dimensional PDE solver based on DL. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that it can compete with a novel stable and accurate compressive spectral collocation method. In particular, we demonstrate a new practical existence theorem, which establishes the existence of a class of trainable DNNs with suitable bounds on the network architecture and a sufficient condition on the sample complexity, with logarithmic or, at worst, linear scaling in dimension, such that the resulting networks stably and accurately approximate a diffusion-reaction PDE with high probability.">

While PINNs have been explored for their utility in inverse analysis, their application in acoustic analysis remains limited.

We categorized the loss parameters into two groups: one dependent on the tube's diameter and another constant, independent of it. The latter were set as the trainable parameters of the neural network. The problem of identifying the loss parameter was formulated as an optimization problem, with the physical properties being determined through this process. The neural network architecture employed was based on our previously proposed ResoNet, which is designed for analyzing acoustic resonance. The efficacy of the proposed method is assessed through both forward and inverse analysis, specifically through the identification of loss parameters. The findings demonstrate that it is feasible to accurately identify parameters that significantly impact the sound field under analysis. By merely altering the governing equations in the loss function, this method could be adapted to various sound fields, suggesting its potential for broad application.">

This fact, along with the requirement of substantial computational resources, poses a barrier to achieving high numerical accuracy. Here, inpsired by DeepONets and to address the above challenges, we present Random Projection-based Operator Networks (RandONets): shallow networks with random projections that learn linear and nonlinear operators. The implementation of RandONets involves: (a) incorporating random bases, thus enabling the use of shallow neural networks with a single hidden layer, where the only unknowns are the output weights of the network's weighted inner product; this reduces dramatically the dimensionality of the parameter space; and, based on this, (b) using established least-squares solvers (e.g., Tikhonov regularization and preconditioned QR decomposition) that offer superior numerical approximation properties compared to other optimization techniques used in deep-learning. In this work, we prove the universal approximation accuracy of RandONets for approximating nonlinear operators and demonstrate their efficiency in approximating linear nonlinear evolution operators (right-hand-sides (RHS)) with a focus on PDEs. We show, that for this particular task, RandONets outperform, both in terms of numerical approximation accuracy and computational cost, the ``vanilla"DeepOnets.">

        <tr id="In this work, we describe a new approach that uses variational encoder-decoder (VED) networks for efficient uncertainty quantification for goal-oriented inverse problems. Contrary to standard inverse problems, these approaches are goal-oriented in that the goal is to estimate some quantities of interest (QoI) that are functions of the solution of an inverse problem, rather than the solution itself. Moreover, we are interested in computing uncertainty metrics associated with the QoI, thus utilizing a Bayesian approach for inverse problems that incorporates the prediction operator and techniques for exploring the posterior. This may be particularly challenging, especially for nonlinear, possibly unknown, operators and nonstandard prior assumptions. We harness recent advances in machine learning, i.e. VED networks, to describe a data-driven approach to large-scale inverse problems. This enables a real-time uncertainty quantification for the QoI. One of the advantages of our approach is that we avoid the need to solve challenging inversion problems by training a network to approximate the mapping from observations to QoI. Another main benefit is that we enable uncertainty quantification for the QoI by leveraging probability distributions in the latent and target spaces. This allows us to efficiently generate QoI samples and circumvent complicated or even unknown forward models and prediction operators. Numerical results from medical tomography reconstruction and nonlinear hydraulic tomography demonstrate the potential and broad applicability of the approach.">

        <tr id="Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved exceptional performance across various fields by learning complex nonlinear mappings from large-scale datasets. However, they encounter challenges such as high computational costs and limited interpretability. To address these issues, hybrid approaches that integrate physics with AI are gaining interest. This paper introduces a novel physics-based AI model called the"Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network", which treats the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE) as a general-purpose trainable model for learning complex patterns including nonlinear mappings and memory effects from data. Existing physics-informed machine learning methods use neural networks to approximate the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In contrast, our approach directly treats the PDE as a trainable model to obtain general nonlinear mappings that would otherwise require neural networks. As a type of physics-AI symbiosis, it offers a more interpretable and parameter-efficient alternative to traditional black-box neural networks, achieving comparable or better accuracy in some time series classification tasks while significantly reducing the number of required parameters. Notably, the trained Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Network is interpretable, with all parameters having physical meanings as properties of a virtual physical system that transforms the data to a more separable space. This interpretability allows for insight into the underlying dynamics of the data transformation process. Applications to time series forecasting have also been explored. While our current implementation utilizes the NLSE, the proposed method of using physics equations as trainable models to learn nonlinear mappings from data is not limited to the NLSE and may be extended to other master equations of physics.">

In this work, we use PINNs to discretize three-dimensional electromagnetic, parametric problems, with material discontinuities, covering both static and transient regimes. By replacing the discontinuous material properties with a continuous approximation, we eliminate the need to directly enforce interface conditions. Using the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we show that using the first-order formulation of Maxwell's equations is more suitable for interface problems.

        <tr id="AI for partial differential equations (PDEs) has garnered significant attention, particularly with the emergence of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recent advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) indicates that there is potential to revisit and enhance the previously MLP-based PINNs. Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a machine learning technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating PDEs as loss terms in neural networks and minimizing the loss function during training. Tomographic imaging, a method to reconstruct internal properties from external measurement data, is highly complex and ill-posed, making it an inverse problem. Recently, PINNs have shown significant potential in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and have advantages in solving inverse problems. However, existing research has primarily focused on semi-inverse Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT), where internal electric potentials are accessible. The practical full inverse EIT problem, where only boundary voltage measurements are available, remains challenging. To address this, we propose a two-stage hybrid learning framework combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and PINNs to solve the full inverse EIT problem. This framework integrates data-driven and model-driven approaches, combines supervised and unsupervised learning, and decouples the forward and inverse problems within the PINN framework in EIT. Stage I: a U-Net constructs an end-to-end mapping from boundary voltage measurements to the internal potential distribution using supervised learning. Stage II: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based PINN takes the predicted internal potentials as input to solve for the conductivity distribution through unsupervised learning.">

Neural operators are a new type of models that can map between function spaces, allowing trained models to emulate the solution operators of PDEs. This paper introduces a novel Fourier neural operator with a multigrid architecture (MgFNO). The MgFNO combines the frequency principle of deep neural networks (DNNs) with the multigrid idea for solving linear systems. To speed up the training process of the FNO, a three-layer V-cycle multigrid architecture is used. This architecture involves training the model multiple times on a coarse grid and then transferring it to a fine grid to accelerate the training of the model. The DNN-based solver learns the solution from low to high frequency, while the multigrid method acquires the solution from high to low frequency. Note that the FNO is a resolution-invariant solution operator, therefore the corresponding calculations are greatly simplified. Finally, experiments are conducted on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The results demonstrate that the proposed MgFNO outperforms the traditional Fourier neural operator.">

        <tr id="To overcome these obstacles and improve computational accuracy and efficiency, this paper presents the Randomized Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RRNN), an innovative approach explicitly crafted for solving multiscale elliptic equations. The RRNN method commences by decomposing the computational domain into non-overlapping subdomains. Within each subdomain, the solution to the localized subproblem is approximated by a randomized radial basis function neural network with a Gaussian kernel. This network is distinguished by the random assignment of width and center coefficients for its activation functions, thereby rendering the training process focused solely on determining the weight coefficients of the output layer. For each subproblem, similar to the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method, a linear system will be formulated on the foundation of a weak formulation. Subsequently, a selection of collocation points is stochastically sampled at the boundaries of the subdomain, ensuring satisfying $C^0$ and $C^1$ continuity and boundary conditions to couple these localized solutions. The network is ultimately trained using the least squares method to ascertain the output layer weights. To validate the RRNN method's effectiveness, an extensive array of numerical experiments has been executed and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the accuracy and efficiency well.">

        <tr id="Scientific computing has been an indispensable tool in applied sciences and engineering, where traditional numerical methods are often employed due to their superior accuracy guarantees. However, these methods often encounter challenges when dealing with problems involving complex geometries. Machine learning-based methods, on the other hand, are mesh-free, thus providing a promising alternative. In particular, operator learning methods have been proposed to learn the mapping from the input space to the solution space, enabling rapid inference of solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) once trained. In this work, we address the parametric elliptic interface problem. Building upon the deep operator network (DeepONet), we propose an extended interface deep operator network (XI-DeepONet). XI-DeepONet exhibits three unique features: (1) The interface geometry is incorporated into the neural network as an additional input, enabling the network to infer solutions for new interface geometries once trained; (2) The level set function associated with the interface geometry is treated as the input, on which the solution mapping is continuous and can be effectively approximated by the deep operator network; (3) The network can be trained without any input-output data pairs, thus completely avoiding the need for meshes of any kind, directly or indirectly. We conduct a comprehensive series of numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.">

Physics-informed convolutional neural networks (PICNNs) extend PINNs by leveraging CNNs for enhanced generalization and efficiency. However, current PICNNs depend on manual design, and inappropriate designs may not effectively solve PDEs. Furthermore, due to the diversity of physical problems, the ideal network architectures and loss functions vary across different PDEs. It is impractical to find the optimal PICNN architecture and loss function for each specific physical problem through extensive manual experimentation. To surmount these challenges, this paper uses automated machine learning (AutoML) to automatically and efficiently search for the loss functions and network architectures of PICNNs. We introduce novel search spaces for loss functions and network architectures and propose a two-stage search strategy. The first stage focuses on searching for factors and residual adjustment operations that influence the loss function, while the second stage aims to find the best CNN architecture. Experimental results show that our automatic searching method significantly outperforms the manually-designed model on multiple datasets.">

C-MAPSS is a well-studied dataset with much existing work in the literature that address RUL prediction with classical and deep learning methods. In the absence of published empirical physical laws governing the C-MAPSS data, our approach first uses stochastic methods to estimate the governing physics models from the noisy time series data. In our approach, we model the various sensor readings as being governed by stochastic differential equations, and we estimate the corresponding transition density mean and variance functions of the underlying processes. We then augment LSTM (long-short term memory) models with the learned mean and variance functions during training and inferencing. Our PIML based approach is different from previous methods, and we use the data to first learn the physics. Our results indicate that PIML discovery and solutions methods are well suited for this problem and outperform previous data-only deep learning methods for this data set and task. Moreover, the framework developed herein is flexible, and can be adapted to other situations (other sensor modalities or combined multi-physics environments), including cases where the underlying physics is only partially observed or known.">

However, the lack of enough validations on more complex flow problems has restricted further development and application of PINN. Our research applies the PINN to simulate a two-dimensional indoor turbulent airflow case to address the issue. Although it is still quite challenging for the PINN to reach an ideal accuracy for the problem through a single purely physics-driven training, our research finds that the PINN prediction accuracy can be significantly improved by exploiting its ability to assimilate high-fidelity data during training, by which the prediction accuracy of PINN is enhanced by 53.2% for pressure, 34.6% for horizontal velocity, and 40.4% for vertical velocity, respectively. Meanwhile, the influence of data points number is also studied, which suggests a balance between prediction accuracy and data acquisition cost can be reached. Last but not least, applying Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence model has also been proved to improve prediction accuracy remarkably. After embedding the standard k–ε model to the PINN, the prediction accuracy was enhanced by 82.9% for pressure, 59.4% for horizontal velocity, and 70.5% for vertical velocity, respectively.

However, NOPT has problems when it comes to dealing with data variability and noisy input measurements that lead to incorrect solutions. Furthermore, nonlinear constraints may result in outcomes that are either infeasible or suboptimal, such as nonconvex optimization. This paper introduces a novel regularized physics-informed neural network (RPINN) framework as a new NOPT tool for both supervised and unsupervised data-driven scenarios. Our RPINN is threefold: By using custom activation functions and regularization penalties in an artificial neural network (ANN), RPINN can handle data variability and noisy inputs. Furthermore, it employs physics principles to construct the network architecture, computing the optimization variables based on network weights and learned features. In addition, it uses automatic differentiation training to make the system scalable and cut down on computation time through batch-based back-propagation. The test results for both supervised and unsupervised NOPT tasks show that our RPINN can provide solutions that are competitive compared to state-of-the-art solvers. In turn, the robustness of RPINN against noisy input measurements makes it particularly valuable in environments with fluctuating information. Specifically, we test a uniform mixture model and a gas-powered system as NOPT scenarios. Overall, with RPINN, its ANN-based foundation offers significant flexibility and scalability.">

        <tr id="We present ConDiff, a novel dataset for scientific machine learning. ConDiff focuses on the diffusion equation with varying coefficients, a fundamental problem in many applications of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). The main novelty of the proposed dataset is that we consider discontinuous coefficients with high contrast. These coefficient functions are sampled from a selected set of distributions. This class of problems is not only of great academic interest, but is also the basis for describing various environmental and industrial problems. In this way, ConDiff shortens the gap with real-world problems while remaining fully synthetic and easy to use. ConDiff consists of a diverse set of diffusion equations with coefficients covering a wide range of contrast levels and heterogeneity with a measurable complexity metric for clearer comparison between different coefficient functions. We baseline ConDiff on standard deep learning models in the field of scientific machine learning. By providing a large number of problem instances, each with its own coefficient function and right-hand side, we hope to encourage the development of novel physics-based deep learning approaches, such as neural operators and physics-informed neural networks, ultimately driving progress towards more accurate and efficient solutions of complex PDE problems.">

This is attributed to the use of partial differential equations (PDE) as the loss function. Usually the loss function of PINN is implemented using automatic differentiation (AD). Inspired by a recent work known as the FDM-PINN [1], we propose to use PDE solver for implementing the loss function. In electrostatics field analysis, there are classical methods that try to solve PDE using numerical approach. Our goal is to complement the merit of classical PDE solver with modern PINN. In our experiment, we tested our PINN approach on a rectangular trough electrostatic field. We showed that our PDE solver based PINN consistently outperforms deep learning baselines in terms of error reduction.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

        <tr id="Mathematical solvers use parametrized Optimization Problems (OPs) as inputs to yield optimal decisions. In many real-world settings, some of these parameters are unknown or uncertain. Recent research focuses on predicting the value of these unknown parameters using available contextual features, aiming to decrease decision regret by adopting end-to-end learning approaches. However, these approaches disregard prediction uncertainty and therefore make the mathematical solver susceptible to provide erroneous decisions in case of low-confidence predictions. We propose a novel framework that models prediction uncertainty with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and propagates this uncertainty into the mathematical solver with a Stochastic Programming technique. The differentiable nature of BNNs and differentiable mathematical solvers allow for two different learning approaches: In the Decoupled learning approach, we update the BNN weights to increase the quality of the predictions' distribution of the OP parameters, while in the Combined learning approach, we update the weights aiming to directly minimize the expected OP's cost function in a stochastic end-to-end fashion. We do an extensive evaluation using synthetic data with various noise properties and a real dataset, showing that decisions regret are generally lower (better) with both proposed methods.">

        <tr id="The deep operator network (DeepONet) is a popular neural operator architecture that has shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by using deep neural networks to map between infinite-dimensional function spaces. In the absence of labeled datasets, we utilize the PDE residual loss to learn the physical system, an approach known as physics-informed DeepONet. This method faces significant computational challenges, primarily due to the curse of dimensionality, as the computational cost increases exponentially with finer discretization. In this paper, we introduce the Separable DeepONet framework to address these challenges and improve scalability for high-dimensional PDEs. Our approach involves a factorization technique where sub-networks handle individual one-dimensional coordinates, thereby reducing the number of forward passes and the size of the Jacobian matrix. By using forward-mode automatic differentiation, we further optimize the computational cost related to the Jacobian matrix. As a result, our modifications lead to a linear scaling of computational cost with discretization density, making Separable DeepONet suitable for high-dimensional PDEs. We validate the effectiveness of the separable architecture through three benchmark PDE models: the viscous Burgers equation, Biot's consolidation theory, and a parametrized heat equation. In all cases, our proposed framework achieves comparable or improved accuracy while significantly reducing computational time compared to conventional DeepONet. These results demonstrate the potential of Separable DeepONet in efficiently solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs, advancing the field of physics-informed machine learning.">

In this work, we tackle it through a principled unified framework using deterministic or stochastic evolutions described by partial differential equations (PDEs). This framework incorporates prior trajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\"odinger bridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allows us to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus sampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization constant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and computational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and discretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading to significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to alternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newton methods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.">

However, for complex problems, training these networks can still be challenging, often resulting in unsatisfactory accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate that the failure of plain physics-informed neural networks arises from the significant discrepancy in the convergence speed of residuals at different training points, where the slowest convergence speed dominates the overall solution convergence. Based on these observations, we propose a point-wise adaptive weighting method that balances the residual decay rate across different training points. The performance of our proposed adaptive weighting method is compared with current state-of-the-art adaptive weighting methods on benchmark problems for both physics-informed neural networks and physics-informed deep operator networks. Through extensive numerical results we demonstrate that our proposed approach of balanced residual decay rates offers several advantages, including bounded weights, high prediction accuracy, fast convergence speed, low training uncertainty, low computational cost and ease of hyperparameter tuning.">

Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) were introduced as a viable alternative, with the potential of offering better interpretability and efficiency while requiring fewer parameters. In this paper, we present a fast JAX-based implementation of grid-dependent Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs) for solving PDEs. We propose an adaptive training scheme for PIKANs, incorporating known MLP-based PINN techniques, introducing an adaptive state transition scheme to avoid loss function peaks between grid updates, and proposing a methodology for designing PIKANs with alternative basis functions. Through comparative experiments we demonstrate that these adaptive features significantly enhance training efficiency and solution accuracy. Our results illustrate the effectiveness of PIKANs in improving performance for PDE solutions, highlighting their potential as a superior alternative in scientific and engineering applications.">

While computational fluid dynamics is precise, it is computationally impractical for real-time control. Lumped thermal models divide the room into cells and explicitly model inter-cell air-mixing. However, solving the coupled differential equations is still computationally challenging. Data-driven methods like long-short term memory may handle non-linear thermal dynamics but face limitations in observability, adherence to physical constraints, and generalization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINN) impose physical constraints even while learning from data. However, PINNs still lack the scalability required for effective control in large open-plan offices, primarily due to air-mixing interactions Our approach, PhyGICS, combines graph neural networks with physics-informed learning (PI-GNN) to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we model the thermodynamic interactions as edges between nodes that represent cells. Further, the modeling approach allows explicit modeling of wall and window surface temperatures that are commonly ignored. PhyGICS, utilizing PI-GNN as a state-estimator, employs a receding-horizon approach for optimal HVAC control. We adapt PI-GNNs for building HVAC control by incorporating a time-resetting strategy to handle time-dependent ambient conditions and therefore set-points.

Then, multiple PINN-based wake surrogates are trained with continuity and momentum conservation knowledge, varying amounts of data, and physics collocation points. It was found that including physics information under the best circumstances could improve accuracy by 18% at the cost of increasing the training time by a factor of 116. The findings imply that physics information can improve neural network based wake surrogates.">

        <tr id="Data-driven modeling methods are studied for turbulent dynamical systems with extreme events under an unambiguous model framework. New neural network architectures are proposed to effectively learn the key dynamical mechanisms including the multiscale coupling and strong instability, and gain robust skill for long-time prediction resistive to the accumulated model errors from the data-driven approximation. The machine learning model overcomes the inherent limitations in traditional long short-time memory networks by exploiting a conditional Gaussian structure informed of the essential physical dynamics. The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime. The model framework is promising to be applied to a wider class of turbulent systems with complex structures.">

To breach the gap between the immense promises we see in RL and the applicability in complex engineering systems, the main challenges are the massive requirements in terms of the training data, as well as the lack of performance guarantees. We present a solution for the first issue using a data-driven surrogate model in the form of a convolutional Long-Short Term Memory network with actuation. We demonstrate that learning an actuated model in parallel to training the RL agent significantly reduces the total amount of required data sampled from the real system. Furthermore, we show that iteratively updating the model is of major importance to avoid biases in the RL training. Detailed ablation studies reveal the most important ingredients of the modeling process. We use the chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation do demonstrate our findings.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method that combines neural operators, physics-informed machine learning, and standard numerical methods for solving PDEs. The proposed approach extends each of the aforementioned methods and unifies them within a single framework. We can parametrically solve partial differential equations in a data-free manner and provide accurate sensitivities, meaning the derivatives of the solution space with respect to the design space. These capabilities enable gradient-based optimization without the typical sensitivity analysis costs, unlike adjoint methods that scale directly with the number of response functions. Our Finite Operator Learning (FOL) approach uses an uncomplicated feed-forward neural network model to directly map the discrete design space (i.e. parametric input space) to the discrete solution space (i.e. finite number of sensor points in the arbitrary shape domain) ensuring compliance with physical laws by designing them into loss functions. The discretized governing equations, as well as the design and solution spaces, can be derived from any well-established numerical techniques. In this work, we employ the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate fields and their spatial derivatives. Subsequently, we conduct Sobolev training to minimize a multi-objective loss function, which includes the discretized weak form of the energy functional, boundary conditions violations, and the stationarity of the residuals with respect to the design variables. Our study focuses on the steady-state heat equation within heterogeneous materials that exhibits significant phase contrast and possibly temperature-dependent conductivity.

We utilize a fractional score function and Physical-informed neural networks (PINN) to lift the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and alleviate numerical overflow from exponentially decaying solutions with dimensions. The introduction of a fractional score function allows us to transform the FPL equation into a second-order partial differential equation without fractional Laplacian and thus can be readily solved with standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We propose two methods to obtain a fractional score function: fractional score matching (FSM) and score-fPINN for fitting the fractional score function. While FSM is more cost-effective, it relies on known conditional distributions. On the other hand, score-fPINN is independent of specific stochastic differential equations (SDEs) but requires evaluating the PINN model's derivatives, which may be more costly. We conduct our experiments on various SDEs and demonstrate numerical stability and effectiveness of our method in dealing with high-dimensional problems, marking a significant advancement in addressing the CoD in FPL equations.">

To handle this problem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines autoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities of Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional representation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian method that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs and outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to surrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings highlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as accurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to external forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.">

Once fully trained, these BIE-based models adeptly predict the solutions of PDEs in any domain without the need for additional training. BI-TDONet notably enhances its performance by employing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of bounded linear operators, allowing for the efficient distribution of input functions across its modules. Furthermore, to tackle the issue of function sampling values that do not effectively capture oscillatory and impulse signal characteristics, trigonometric coefficients are utilized as both inputs and outputs in BI-TDONet.

Classic solvers for this task continue to play a central role, e.g. to generate training data for deep learning analogues. Any such numerical solution is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, both from limited computational resources and limited data (including unknown parameters). Gaussian process analogues to classic PDE simulation methods have recently emerged as a framework to construct fully probabilistic estimates of all these types of uncertainty. So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable.

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

Despite successful development of PINNs in various systems, computational efficiency and fidelity prediction have remained profound challenges. To fill such gaps, this study proposed a Physics‐Informed Neural Operator Solver (PINOS) to achieve accurate and fast simulations without any required data set. The training of PINOS adopts a weak form based on the principle of least work for static simulations and a storng form for dynamic systems in solid mechanics. Results from numerical examples indicated that PINOS is capable of approximating solutions notably faster than the benchmarks of PINNs in both static an dynamic systems. The comparisons also showed that PINOS reached a convergence speed of over 20 times faster than finite element software in two‐dimensional and three‐dimensional static problems. Furthermore, this study examined the zero‐shot super‐resolution capability by developing Super‐Resolution PINOS (SR‐PINOS) that was trained on a coarse mesh and validated on fine mesh. The numerical results demonstrate the great performance of the model to obtain accurate solutions with a speed up, suggesting effectiveness in increasing sampling points and scaling a simulation. This study also discusses the differentiation methods of PINOS and SR‐PINOS and suggests potential implementations related to forward applications for promising machine learning methods for structural designs and optimization.">

To learn this iterative solver, we propose an unsupervised training algorithm that builds on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, modified by a Fischer-Burmeister formulation, and eliminates the need for prior sampling of exact optimizer solutions. By exploiting efficient vector-Jacobian and Jacobian-vector products via automatic differentiation, the proposed training algorithm can be efficiently executed.

While these operators perform effectively in either the time or frequency domain, their performance may be limited when applied to non-stationary spatial or temporal signals whose frequency characteristics change with time. Here, we introduce Complex Neural Operator (CoNO) that parameterizes the integral kernel using Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), better representing non-stationary signals in a complex-valued domain. Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

        <tr id="The precise simulation of turbulent flows is of immense importance in a variety of scientific and engineering fields, including climate science, freshwater science, and the development of energy-efficient manufacturing processes. Within the realm of turbulent flow simulation, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is widely considered to be the most reliable approach, but it is prohibitively expensive for long-term simulation at fine spatial scales. Given the pressing need for efficient simulation, there is an increasing interest in building machine learning models for turbulence, either by reconstructing DNS from alternative low-fidelity simulations or by predicting DNS based on the patterns learned from historical data. However, standard machine learning techniques remain limited in capturing complex spatio-temporal characteristics of turbulent flows, resulting in limited performance and generalizability. This paper presents a novel physics-enhanced neural operator (PENO) that incorporates physical knowledge of partial differential equations (PDEs) to accurately model flow dynamics. The model is further refined by a self-augmentation mechanism to reduce the accumulated error in long-term simulations. The proposed method is evaluated through its performance on two distinct sets of 3D turbulent flow data, showcasing the model's capability to reconstruct high-resolution DNS data, maintain the inherent physical properties of flow transport, and generate flow simulations across various resolutions. Additionally, experimental results on multiple 2D vorticity flow series, generated by different PDEs, highlight the transferability and generalizability of the proposed method. This confirms its applicability to a wide range of real-world scenarios in which extensive simulations are needed under diverse settings.">

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks.

Traditional methods, primarily offline and data-driven, struggle with adapting to real-time changes and new process scenarios, which limits their applicability for effective AM process control. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the first physics-informed (PI) online learning framework specifically designed for temperature prediction in metal AM. Utilizing a physics-informed neural network (PINN), this framework integrates a neural network architecture with physics-informed inputs and loss functions. Pretrained on a known process to establish a baseline, the PINN transitions to an online learning phase, dynamically updating its weights in response to new, unseen data. This adaptation allows the model to continuously refine its predictions in real-time. By integrating physics-informed components, the PINN leverages prior knowledge about the manufacturing processes, enabling rapid adjustments to process parameters, geometries, deposition patterns, and materials. Empirical results confirm the robust performance of this PI online learning framework in accurately predicting temperature fields for unseen processes across various conditions. It notably surpasses traditional data-driven models, especially in critical areas like the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and melt pool. The PINN’s use of physical laws and prior knowledge not only provides a significant advantage over conventional models but also ensures more accurate predictions under diverse conditions. Furthermore, our analysis of key hyperparameters—the learning rate and batch size of the online learning phase—highlights their roles in optimizing the learning process and enhancing the framework’s overall effectiveness. This approach demonstrates significant potential to improve the online control and optimization of metal AM processes.">

The training is carried out in a self-supervised manner, similar to pretraining approaches applied in language and vision tasks. We hypothesize that the model is in effect learning a family of operators (for multiple parameters) mapping the initial condition to the solution of the PDE at any future time step t. We compare this approach with the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and demonstrate that it can generalize over the space of PDE parameters, despite having a higher prediction error for individual parameter values compared to the FNO.

These problems are modeled by partial differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs. The proposed method involves two separate CNNs: Basis CNNs and Coefficient CNNs (Coef CNNs), which correspond to two main parts of ROM. The method is called CNN-based ROM. The former one learns input-specific basis functions from the snapshots of fine-scale solutions. An activation function, inspired by Galerkin projection, is utilized at the output layer to reconstruct fine-scale solutions from the basis functions. Numerical results show that the basis functions learned by the Basis CNNs resemble data, which help to significantly reduce the number of the basis functions. Moreover, CNN-based ROM is less sensitive to data fluctuation caused by numerical errors than traditional ROM. Since the tests of Basis CNNs still need fine-scale stiffness matrix and load vector, it can not be directly applied to nonlinear problems. The Coef CNNs can be applied to nonlinear problems and designed to determine the coefficients for linear combination of basis functions. In addition, two applications of CNN-based ROM are presented, including predicting MsFEM basis functions within oversampling regions and building accurate surrogates for inverse problems.">

In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Probabilistic BNN (ProbBNN), which leverages probabilistic computing principles to streamline the inference process. Unlike traditional deterministic approaches, ProbBNN represents inputs and parameters as random variables governed by probability distributions, allowing for the propagation of uncertainty throughout the network. We employ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to represent the parameters of each neuron or convolutional kernel, enabling efficient encoding and processing of uncertainty. Our approach simplifies the inference process by replacing complex deterministic computations with lightweight probabilistic operations, resulting in reduced computational complexity and improved scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbBNN in achieving competitive accuracy to traditional BNNs while significantly reducing the number of parameters. The transition to ProbBNN yields a reduction of two orders of magnitude in the number of parameters compared to baseline approaches, making our approach promising for deployment in resource-constrained applications such as edge computing and IoT devices.">

As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets.

Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear elasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili representation of the solution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural network to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while automatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing the network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation functions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem guaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural networks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a new tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of vanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach, noteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem include a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the boundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of training points, and $C^\infty$ regularity of the learned solution. Several benchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN approximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the possibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a domain-decomposition strategy.">

PeFNN is designed to enforce momentum conservation and yields interpretable nonlinear expressions by utilizing unique multi-scale momentum-conserving Fourier (MC-Fourier) layers and an element-wise product operation. The MC-Fourier layer is by design translation- and rotation-invariant in the frequency domain, serving as a plug-and-play module that adheres to the laws of momentum conservation. PeFNN establishes a new state-of-the-art in solving widely employed spatiotemporal PDEs and generalizes well across input resolutions. Further, we demonstrate its outstanding performance for challenging real-world applications such as large-scale flood simulations.">

We propose a spatially dependent physics-informed neural network (SD-PINN), which enables recovering coefficients in spatially dependent PDEs using one neural network, eliminating the requirement for domain-specific physical expertise. The network is trained by minimizing a combination of loss functions involving data-fitting and physical constraints, in which the requirement for satisfying the assumed governing PDE is encoded. For the recovery of spatially two-dimensional (2D) PDEs, we store the PDE coefficients at all locations in the 2D region of interest into a matrix and incorporate a low-rank assumption for this matrix to recover the coefficients at locations without measurements. We apply the SD-PINN to recovering spatially dependent coefficients of the wave equation to reveal the spatial distribution of acoustic properties in the inhomogeneous medium.">

NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible.

Techniques for estimating such a design are commonly used within the framework of parameter estimation. Nonetheless, in recent years parameter estimation techniques are changing rapidly with the introduction of deep learning techniques to replace traditional estimation methods. This in turn requires the adaptation of optimal experimental design that is associated with these new techniques. In this paper we investigate a new experimental design methodology that uses deep learning. We show that the training of a network as a Likelihood Free Estimator can be used to significantly simplify the design process and circumvent the need for the computationally expensive bi-level optimization problem that is inherent in optimal experimental design for non-linear systems. Furthermore, deep design improves the quality of the recovery process for parameter estimation problems. As proof of concept we apply our methodology to two different systems of Ordinary Differential Equations.">

Using Bayes Theorem and conditional probability densities, we demonstrate how each uncertainty source can be systematically quantified. We also introduce a fast and practical way to incorporate and combine all sources of errors for the first time. For illustration, the new method is applied to quantify errors in cloud autoconversion rates, predicted from an artificial neural network that was trained by aircraft cloud probe measurements in the Azores and the stochastic collection equation formulated as a two-moment bin model. For this specific example, the output uncertainty arising from uncertainty in the training and testing data is dominant, followed by uncertainty in the input data, in the trained neural network, and uncertainty in the weights. We discuss the usefulness of the methodology for machine learning practice, and how, through inclusion of uncertainty in the training data, the new methodology is less sensitive to input data that falls outside of the training data set.">

Our study focuses on examining the generalization error as a component of the total error in the DBDP framework, discovering that the rate of convergence for the generalization error is influenced by the choice of sampling methods. Specifically, for a given batch size $m$, the generalization error under QMC methods exhibits a convergence rate of $O(m^{-1+\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon$ can be made arbitrarily small. This rate is notably more favorable than that of the traditional Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which is $O(m^{-1/2+\varepsilon})$. Our theoretical analysis shows that the generalization error under QMC methods achieves a higher order of convergence than their MC counterparts. Numerical experiments demonstrate that QMC indeed surpasses MC in delivering solutions that are both more precise and stable.">

Although benefiting from favourable properties of NeFs such as grid-agnosticity and space-time-continuous dynamics modelling, this approach limits the ability to impose known constraints of the PDE on the solutions -- e.g. symmetries or boundary conditions -- in favour of modelling flexibility. Instead, we propose a space-time continuous NeF-based solving framework that - by preserving geometric information in the latent space - respects known symmetries of the PDE. We show that modelling solutions as flows of pointclouds over the group of interest $G$ improves generalization and data-efficiency. We validated that our framework readily generalizes to unseen spatial and temporal locations, as well as geometric transformations of the initial conditions - where other NeF-based PDE forecasting methods fail - and improve over baselines in a number of challenging geometries.">

This paper proposes a novel DAgger framework that integrates Bayesian uncertainty estimation via mean field variational inference (MFVI) to address this issue. MFVI provides better-calibrated uncertainty estimates compared to prior methods. During training, the framework identifies both uncertain and critical states, querying the expert only for these states. This targeted data collection reduces the burden on the expert and improves data efficiency.

Traditional methods for identifying self-similarity often rely on specific models, which can introduce significant bias. In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

Then, the system-specific vector field is predicted by modeling the Hamiltonian using a Gaussian process (GP) with neural network-based mean and kernel functions that depend on the inferred system representation. This GP-based Hamiltonian allows us to analytically obtain predictions that are adapted to small data while imposing the constraint of the conservation law. The neural networks are shared across systems, which enables us to learn knowledge from multiple systems, and use it for unseen systems. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods for predicting dynamics from a small number of observations in target systems.">

        <tr id="Scenario-based optimization and control has proven to be an efficient approach to account for system uncertainty. In particular, the performance of scenario-based model predictive control (MPC) schemes depends on the accuracy of uncertainty quantification. However, current learning- and scenario-based MPC (sMPC) approaches employ a single timeinvariant probabilistic model (learned offline), which may not accurately describe time-varying uncertainties. Instead, this paper presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) of Bayesian neural networks (BNN) for adaptive uncertainty quantification that would be subsequently used for adaptive-scenario-tree model predictive control design of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics to enhance control performance. In particular, the proposed approach learns both a global BNN model and an updating law to refine the BNN model. At each time step, the updating law transforms the global BNN model into more precise local BNN models in real time. The adapted local model is then used to generate scenarios for sMPC design at each time step. A probabilistic safety certificate is incorporated in the scenario generation to ensure that the trajectories of the generated scenarios contain the real trajectory of the system and that all the scenarios adhere to the constraints with a high probability. Experiments using closed-loop simulations of a numerical example demonstrate that the proposed approach can improve the performance of scenario-based MPC compared to using only one BNN model learned offline for all time steps.">

        <tr id="Energy based models (EBMs) are appealing for their generality and simplicity in data likelihood modeling, but have conventionally been difficult to train due to the unstable and time-consuming implicit MCMC sampling during contrastive divergence training. In this paper, we present a novel energy-based generative framework, Variational Potential Flow (VAPO), that entirely dispenses with implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on complementary latent models or cooperative training. The VAPO framework aims to learn a potential energy function whose gradient (flow) guides the prior samples, so that their density evolution closely follows an approximate data likelihood homotopy. An energy loss function is then formulated to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between density evolution of the flow-driven prior and the data likelihood homotopy. Images can be generated after training the potential energy, by initializing the samples from Gaussian prior and solving the ODE governing the potential flow on a fixed time interval using generic ODE solvers. Experiment results show that the proposed VAPO framework is capable of generating realistic images on various image datasets. In particular, our proposed framework achieves competitive FID scores for unconditional image generation on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets.">

        <tr id="Enhancing the sparsity of data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation by building sparse causation-based ROMs for various purposes, such as recovering long-term statistics and inferring unobserved dynamics via data assimilation with partial observations.">

        <tr id="We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.">

        <tr id="Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.">

Hitherto, deep learning-based methods employed to model hysteresis, face challenges in generalizing to novel input magnetic fields. This paper addresses the generalization challenge by proposing neural operators for modeling constitutive laws that exhibit magnetic hysteresis by learning a mapping between magnetic fields. In particular, two prominent neural operators -- deep operator network and Fourier neural operator -- are employed to predict novel first-order reversal curves and minor loops, where novel means they are not used to train the model. In addition, a rate-independent Fourier neural operator is proposed to predict material responses at sampling rates different from those used during training to incorporate the rate-independent characteristics of magnetic hysteresis. The presented numerical experiments demonstrate that neural operators efficiently model magnetic hysteresis, outperforming the traditional neural recurrent methods on various metrics and generalizing to novel magnetic fields. The findings emphasize the advantages of using neural operators for modeling hysteresis under varying magnetic conditions, underscoring their importance in characterizing magnetic material based devices.">

        <tr id="This work introduces neural Green's operators (NGOs), a novel neural operator network architecture that learns the solution operator for a parametric family of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The proof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian densities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method can be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any linear observable of the discrete field theory.

Existing analytical and numerical methods do not always provide efficient solutions for such problems. Recently, neural networks have been successfully applied to solve PDEs, typically addressing boundary value problems for domains with simple shapes. This paper attempts to construct a neural network capable of effectively solving boundary value problems for domains of complex shapes.Materials and Methods. A method for constructing a neural network to solve the Dirichlet problem for regions of complex shape is proposed. Derivatives of singular solutions of the Laplace equation are accepted as activation functions. Singular points of these solutions are distributed along closed curves encompassing the boundary of the domain. The adjustment of the network weights is reduced to minimizing the root-mean-square error during training.Results. The results of solving Dirichlet problems for various complex-shaped domains are presented. The results are provided in tables, comparing the exact solution and the solution obtained using the neural network. Figures show the domain shapes and the locations of points where the solutions were determined.Discussion and Conclusion. The presented results indicate a good agreement between the obtained solution and the exact one. It is noted that this method can be easily applied to various boundary value problems. Methods for enhancing the efficiency of such neural networks are suggested.">

        <tr id="Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.">

Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor. These performances offer significant promise for data-driven scientific discovery and interpretation.">

While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks. At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.">

The Bayesian nature of the particle filter is utilized to update MLP parameters, providing flexibility to the method and accommodating unexpected changes in the degradation behavior.

Adjustment includes variation in the number of neurons or layers in the MLP, threshold adjustments, initial training refinements and the adaptation of the process noise. Addressing different degradation processes across these applications, MLP-PF proves its adaptability and utility in various contexts. These findings highlight the method’s versatility in adapting to diverse use cases and its potential as a robust prognostic tool across various industries.

However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is “learnable” and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

This imposes a pressing need to develop fast and accurate methods for computing the matter power spectrum $P(k)$, or equivalently, the matter transfer function $T(k)$. In previous works, we introduced precise fitting formulas for these quantities within the standard cosmological model, including extensions such as the presence of massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. However, these formulations overlooked a key characteristic imprinted in $P(k)$: the baryon acoustic oscillation signal. Here, we leverage our understanding of the well-known physics behind this oscillatory pattern to impose constraints on our genetic algorithm, a machine learning technique. By employing this ``physics-informed'' approach, we introduce an expression that accurately describes the matter transfer function with sub-percent mean accuracy. The high interpretability of the output allows for straightforward extensions of this formulation to other scenarios involving massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity. We anticipate that this formula will serve as a competitive fitting function for $P(k)$, meeting the accuracy requirements essential for cosmological analyses.">

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

Fusing known physics into data-driven learners allows modelling practitioners to combine the expressive power of traditional machine learning with known mechanistic laws, where the objective is to enhance predictive performance, interpretability, and model generalisation. A core consideration that must be made when implementing a physics-informed learning architecture is how relevant knowledge will be embedded into the model structure, which, generally, is informed by the type of physics that is available. Frequently this knowledge may not be complete, with only a partial understanding of the governing physics available. 

In this work, possible paths for deriving Gaussian process kernels that are representative of partial knowledge will be considered. How the type of knowledge that is possessed influences the derivation will be explored, particularly when there is the potential for some aspect of misspecified physics. An example of deriving partially structured kernels will be investigated for modelling the decoupled response of a GARTEUR laboratory aircraft structure, where the derived kernels are used to decompose the dynamics of the aircraft into modal contributions.

Since error majorant provides a direct upper bound on error, one can reliably estimate how close PiNN is to the exact solution and stop the optimization process when the desired accuracy is reached. We call loss function associated with error majorant $\textbf{Astral}$: neur$\textbf{A}$l a po$\textbf{ST}$erio$\textbf{RI}$ function$\textbf{A}$l Loss. To compare Astral and residual loss functions, we illustrate how error majorants can be derived for various PDEs and conduct experiments with diffusion equations (including anisotropic and in the L-shaped domain), convection-diffusion equation, temporal discretization of Maxwell's equation, and magnetostatics problem. The results indicate that Astral loss is competitive to the residual loss, typically leading to faster convergence and lower error (e.g., for Maxwell's equations, we observe an order of magnitude better relative error and training time). We also report that the error estimate obtained with Astral loss is usually tight enough to be informative, e.g., for a highly anisotropic equation, on average, Astral overestimates error by a factor of $1.5$, and for convection-diffusion by a factor of $1.7$.">

Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data.

We focus on a class of equations that are linear in their parameters (with unknown coefficients $\theta_\star$). We show that when the partial differential equation admits a classical solution (say $u_\star$), differentiable to order $\beta$, the mean square error of the Bayesian posterior mean is at least of order $n^{-2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$.

For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.">

        <tr id="Recently, advancements in deep learning have enabled physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerical differentiation (ND) using the finite difference (FD) method is efficient in physics-constrained designs, even in parameterized settings, often employing body-fitted block-structured grids for complex flow cases. However, convolution operators in CNNs for finite differences are typically limited to single-block grids. To address this, we use graphs and graph networks (GNs) to learn flow representations across multi-block structured grids. We propose a graph convolution-based finite difference method (GC-FDM) to train GNs in a physics-constrained manner, enabling differentiable finite difference operations on graph unstructured outputs. Our goal is to solve parametric steady incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows around a backward-facing step, a circular cylinder, and double cylinders, using multi-block structured grids. Comparing our method to a CFD solver under various boundary conditions, we demonstrate improved training efficiency and accuracy, achieving a minimum relative error of $10^{-3}$ in velocity field prediction and a 20\% reduction in training cost compared to PINNs.">

        <tr id="It is a challenging topic in applied mathematics to solve high-dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Standard approximation methods for nonlinear PDEs suffer under the curse of dimensionality (COD) in the sense that the number of computational operations of the approximation method grows at least exponentially in the PDE dimension and with such methods it is essentially impossible to approximately solve high-dimensional PDEs even when the fastest currently available computers are used. However, in the last years great progress has been made in this area of research through suitable deep learning (DL) based methods for PDEs in which deep neural networks (DNNs) are used to approximate solutions of PDEs. Despite the remarkable success of such DL methods in simulations, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to prove (or disprove) that such methods can overcome the COD in the approximation of PDEs. However, there are nowadays several partial error analysis results for DL methods for high-dimensional nonlinear PDEs in the literature which prove that DNNs can overcome the COD in the sense that the number of parameters of the approximating DNN grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy $\varepsilon>0$ and the PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. In the main result of this article we prove that for all $T,p\in(0,\infty)$ it holds that solutions $u_d\colon[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, of semilinear heat equations with Lipschitz continuous nonlinearities can be approximated in the $L^p$-sense on space-time regions without the COD by DNNs with the rectified linear unit (ReLU), the leaky ReLU, or the softplus activation function. In previous articles similar results have been established not for space-time regions but for the solutions $u_d(T,\cdot)$, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, at the terminal time $T$.">

        <tr id="Extreme learning machine (ELM) is a methodology for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. It presets the weight/bias coefficients in the hidden layer with random values, which remain fixed throughout the computation, and uses a linear least squares method for training the parameters of the output layer of the neural network. It is known to be much faster than Physics informed neural networks. However, classical ELM is still computationally expensive when a high level of representation is desired in the solution as this requires solving a large least squares system. In this paper, we propose a nonoverlapping domain decomposition method (DDM) for ELMs that not only reduces the training time of ELMs, but is also suitable for parallel computation. In numerical analysis, DDMs have been widely studied to reduce the time to obtain finite element solutions for elliptic PDEs through parallel computation. Among these approaches, nonoverlapping DDMs are attracting the most attention. Motivated by these methods, we introduce local neural networks, which are valid only at corresponding subdomains, and an auxiliary variable at the interface. We construct a system on the variable and the parameters of local neural networks. A Schur complement system on the interface can be derived by eliminating the parameters of the output layer. The auxiliary variable is then directly obtained by solving the reduced system after which the parameters for each local neural network are solved in parallel. A method for initializing the hidden layer parameters suitable for high approximation quality in large systems is also proposed. Numerical results that verify the acceleration performance of the proposed method with respect to the number of subdomains are presented.">

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

        <tr id="Stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are the foundation for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. The drift and volatility functions in SDE models are typically chosen to be algebraic functions with a small number (less than 5) parameters which can be calibrated to market data. A more flexible approach is to use neural networks to model the drift and volatility functions, which provides more degrees-of-freedom to match observed market data. Training of models requires optimizing over an SDE, which is computationally challenging. For European options, we develop a fast stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for training the neural network-SDE model. Our SGD algorithm uses two independent SDE paths to obtain an unbiased estimate of the direction of steepest descent. For American options, we optimize over the corresponding Kolmogorov partial differential equation (PDE). The neural network appears as coefficient functions in the PDE. Models are trained on large datasets (many contracts), requiring either large simulations (many Monte Carlo samples for the stock price paths) or large numbers of PDEs (a PDE must be solved for each contract). Numerical results are presented for real market data including S&P 500 index options, S&P 100 index options, and single-stock American options. The neural-network-based SDE models are compared against the Black-Scholes model, the Dupire's local volatility model, and the Heston model.

This paper compares and contrasts two different types of data‐driven modelling approaches, namely the series/parallel all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural network models and models from a Bayesian ML approach. Both types of AI modelling approaches considered in this work have shown to significantly outperform several state‐of‐the‐art steady‐state and dynamic data‐driven modelling techniques for various performance measures, specifically, model sparsity, predictive capabilities, and computational expense. The performances of the proposed model structures and algorithms have been evaluated for two nonlinear dynamic chemical engineering systems—a plug‐flow reactor for vapour phase cracking of acetone for production of acetic anhydride and a pilot‐plant for post‐combustion CO2 capture using monoethanolamine as the solvent. For the validation data from the CO2 capture pilot plant, root mean squared error (RMSE) for flue gas outlet temperature, flowrate and CO2 concentration is 0.05%, 1.07%, and 5.0%, respectively, for the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks and 0.1%, 1.75%, and 14.14%, respectively, for the Bayesian ML models. For the plug flow reactor data, the Bayesian ML models yield superior RMSE compared to the all‐nonlinear static‐dynamic neural networks when the measurement data are corrupted with Gaussian, auto‐correlated, or cross‐correlated noise.">

        <tr id="GreenLearning networks (GL) directly learn Green's function in physical space, making them an interpretable model for capturing unknown solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). For many PDEs, the corresponding Green's function exhibits asymptotic smoothness. In this paper, we propose a framework named Green Multigrid networks (GreenMGNet), an operator learning algorithm designed for a class of asymptotically smooth Green's functions. Compared with the pioneering GL, the new framework presents itself with better accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving a significant improvement. GreenMGNet is composed of two technical novelties. First, Green's function is modeled as a piecewise function to take into account its singular behavior in some parts of the hyperplane. Such piecewise function is then approximated by a neural network with augmented output(AugNN) so that it can capture singularity accurately. Second, the asymptotic smoothness property of Green's function is used to leverage the Multi-Level Multi-Integration (MLMI) algorithm for both the training and inference stages. Several test cases of operator learning are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method. On average, GreenMGNet achieves $3.8\%$ to $39.15\%$ accuracy improvement. To match the accuracy level of GL, GreenMGNet requires only about $10\%$ of the full grid data, resulting in a $55.9\%$ and $92.5\%$ reduction in training time and GPU memory cost for one-dimensional test problems, and a $37.7\%$ and $62.5\%$ reduction for two-dimensional test problems.">

In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either"from scratch"to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data. We formulate the theory and provide several computational examples to justify both approaches, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings.">

        <tr id="Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause progressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase field models have been developed. However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.">

        <tr id="Deep learning has become a crucial technology for making breakthroughs in many fields. Nevertheless, it still faces two important challenges in theoretical and applied aspects. The first lies in the shortcomings of gradient descent based learning schemes which are time-consuming and difficult to determine the learning control hyperparameters. Next, the architectural design of the model is usually tricky. In this paper, we propose a semi-adaptive synergetic two-way pseudoinverse learning system, wherein each subsystem encompasses forward learning, backward learning, and feature concatenation modules. The whole system is trained using a non-gradient descent learning algorithm. It simplifies the hyperparameter tuning while improving the training efficiency. The architecture of the subsystems is designed using a data-driven approach that enables automated determination of the depth of the subsystems. We compare our method with the baselines of mainstream non-gradient descent based methods and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.">

 We present a variational approach aimed at enhancing the training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and more general surrogate models for learning partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we extend our formerly introduced notion of Sobolev cubatures to negative orders, enabling the approximation of negative order Sobolev norms. We mathematically prove the effect of negative order Sobolev cubatures in improving the condition number of discrete PDE learning problems, providing balancing scalars that mitigate numerical stiffness issues caused by loss imbalances. Additionally, we consider polynomial surrogate models (PSMs), which maintain the flexibility of PINN formulations while preserving the convexity structure of the PDE operators. The combination of negative order Sobolev cubatures and PSMs delivers well-conditioned discrete optimization problems, solvable via an exponentially fast convergent gradient descent for λ-convex losses. Our theoretical contributions are supported by numerical experiments, addressing linear and non-linear, forward and inverse PDE problems. These experiments show that the Sobolev cubature-based PSMs emerge as the superior state-of-the-art PINN technique.">

We demonstrate that the choice of NN architecture significantly influences the objective landscape and the optimizer's path to an optimum. Notably, NNs introduce non-convexities even in otherwise convex landscapes, potentially delaying convergence in convex problems but enhancing exploration for non-convex problems. This analysis lays the groundwork for future advancements by highlighting: 1) the potential of neural TO for non-convex problems and dedicated GPU hardware (the"good"), 2) the limitations in smooth landscapes (the"bad"), and 3) the complex challenge of selecting optimal NN architectures and hyperparameters for superior performance (the"ugly").">

        <tr id="Deep learning models have significantly improved prediction accuracy in various fields, gaining recognition across numerous disciplines. Yet, an aspect of deep learning that remains insufficiently addressed is the assessment of prediction uncertainty. Producing reliable uncertainty estimators could be crucial in practical terms. For instance, predictions associated with a high degree of uncertainty could be sent for further evaluation. Recent works in uncertainty quantification of deep learning predictions, including Bayesian posterior credible intervals and a frequentist confidence-interval estimation, have proven to yield either invalid or overly conservative intervals. Furthermore, there is currently no method for quantifying uncertainty that can accommodate deep neural networks for survival (time-to-event) data that involves right-censored outcomes. In this work, we provide a valid non-parametric bootstrap method that correctly disentangles data uncertainty from the noise inherent in the adopted optimization algorithm, ensuring that the resulting point-wise confidence intervals or the simultaneous confidence bands are accurate (i.e., valid and not overly conservative). The proposed ad-hoc method can be easily integrated into any deep neural network without interfering with the training process. The utility of the proposed approach is illustrated by constructing simultaneous confidence bands for survival curves derived from deep neural networks for survival data with right censoring.">

This article introduces a deep learning framework, the supersonic physics-constrained network (SPC), for the rapid solution of unsteady supersonic flow problems. SPC integrates deep convolutional neural networks with physics-constrained methods based on the Euler equation to derive a new loss function that can accurately calculate the flow fields by considering the spatial and temporal characteristics of the flow fields at the previous moment. Compared to purely data-driven methods, SPC significantly reduces the dependency on training data volume by incorporating physical constraints. Additionally, the training process of SPC is more stable than that of data-driven methods. Taking the classic supersonic forward step flow as an example, SPC can accurately calculate strong discontinuities in the flow fields, while reducing the data volume by approximately 60%. In the generalization test experiment for forward step flow and compression ramp flow, SPC also demonstrates good predictive accuracy and generalization capability under different geometric configurations and inflow conditions.">

However, these models often lose critical information when simplified to lower dimensions and face challenges in parameter definition, especially with the complex 3D shapes commonly found in industrial datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian graph neural network (GNN) framework for a 3D deep-learning-based surrogate model that predicts engineering performance by directly learning geometric features from CAD using mesh representation. Our framework determines the optimal size of mesh elements through Bayesian optimization, resulting in a high-accuracy surrogate model. Additionally, it effectively handles the irregular and complex structures of 3D CADs, which differ significantly from the regular and uniform pixel structures of 2D images typically used in deep learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the quality of the mesh significantly impacts the prediction accuracy of the surrogate model, with an optimally sized mesh achieving superior performance. We compare the performance of models based on various 3D representations such as voxel, point cloud, and graph, and evaluate the computational costs of Monte Carlo simulation and Bayesian optimization methods to find the optimal mesh size. We anticipate that our proposed framework has the potential to be applied to mesh-based simulations across various engineering fields, leveraging physics-based information commonly used in computer-aided engineering.">

Despite these advances, our understanding of how pretraining affects neural operators is still limited; studies generally propose tailored architectures and datasets that make it challenging to compare or examine different pretraining frameworks. To address this, we compare various pretraining methods without optimizing architecture choices to characterize pretraining dynamics on different models and datasets as well as to understand its scaling and generalization behavior. We find that pretraining is highly dependent on model and dataset choices, but in general transfer learning or physics-based pretraining strategies work best. In addition, pretraining performance can be further improved by using data augmentations. Lastly, pretraining is additionally beneficial when fine-tuning in scarce data regimes or when generalizing to downstream data similar to the pretraining distribution.

 The growing time-series data make it possible to glimpse the hidden dynamics in various fields. However, developing a computational toolbox with high interpretability to unveil the interaction dynamics from data remains a crucial challenge. Here, we propose a new computational approach called Automated Dynamical Model Inference based on Expression Trees (ADMIET), in which the machine learning algorithm, the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and the interpretability from prior knowledge are embedded into the symbolic learning scheme to establish a general framework for revealing the hidden dynamics in time-series data. ADMIET takes full advantage of both machine learning algorithm and expression tree. Firstly, we translate the prior knowledge into constraints on the structure of expression tree, reducing the search space and enhancing the interpretability. Secondly, we utilize the proposed adaptive penalty function to ensure the convergence of gradient descent algorithm and the selection of the symbols. Compared to gene expression programming, ADMIET exhibits its remarkable capability in function fitting with higher accuracy and broader applicability. Moreover, ADMIET can better fit parameters in nonlinear forms compared to regression methods. Furthermore, we apply ADMIET to two typical biological systems and one real data with different prior knowledge to infer the dynamical equations. The results indicate that ADMIET can not only discover the interaction relationships but also provide accurate estimates of the parameters in the equations. These results demonstrate ADMIET's superiority in revealing interpretable dynamics from time-series biological data.">

Each loss function consists of two components where the first component compares the difference between the weights from the neural network and WENO3-JS weights, while the second component matches the output weights of the neural network and the linear weights. The former of the loss function enforces the neural network to follow the WENO properties, implying that there is no need for the post-processing layer. Additionally the latter leads to better performance around discontinuities. As a neural network structure, we choose the shallow neural network (SNN) for computational efficiency with the Delta layer consisting of the normalized undivided differences.

This method was applied to learn and predict two-dimensional steady advection–diffusion physical fields with absorption and source terms, and its accuracy and performance were tested and verified by a series of numerical experiments with different B-spline sets, boundary conditions, field gradients, and field states. The proposed method was finally compared with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a physics-informed neural network (PINN).

        <tr id="Classical model reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

In response to this gap, this paper introduces a novel approach for eddy current analysis employing a transfer learning-based discrete differentiation method within the framework of a PINN. While discrete differentiation methods offer the advantage of low model complexity and rapid analysis, they encounter challenges in eddy current analysis due to the need for learning at each time step. This paper addresses these challenges through the application of transfer learning techniques.

Second, we represent the value function using a neural network and train it to solve the differential equation using deep learning tools. We refer to the solution as an Economic Model Informed Neural Network (EMINN). The main advantage of this technique is that it allows us to find global solutions to high dimensional, non-linear problems.

The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

Since then, variational calculus has developed intensively as many problems in physics and engineering are described by equations from this branch of mathematical analysis. This paper presents two non-classical, distinct methods for solving such problems. The first method is based on the differential transform method (DTM), which seeks an analytical solution in the form of a certain functional series. The second method, on the other hand, is based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN), where artificial intelligence in the form of a neural network is used to solve the differential equation. In addition to describing both methods, this paper also presents numerical examples along with a comparison of the obtained results.Comparingthe two methods, DTM produced marginally more accurate results than PINNs. While PINNs exhibited slightly higher errors, their performance remained commendable. The key strengths of neural networks are their adaptability and ease of implementation. Both approaches discussed in the article are effective for addressing the examined problems.">

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

However, AI-based FDTD solvers for photonic devices have not been clearly formulated. Directly applying off-the-shelf models to predict the optical field dynamics shows unsatisfying fidelity and efficiency since the model primitives are agnostic to the unique physical properties of Maxwell equations and lack algorithmic customization. In this work, we thoroughly investigate the synergy between neural operator designs and the physical property of Maxwell equations and introduce a physics-inspired AI-based FDTD prediction framework PIC2O-Sim which features a causality-aware dynamic convolutional neural operator as its backbone model that honors the space-time causality constraints via careful receptive field configuration and explicitly captures the permittivity-dependent light propagation behavior via an efficient dynamic convolution operator. Meanwhile, we explore the trade-offs among prediction scalability, fidelity, and efficiency via a multi-stage partitioned time-bundling technique in autoregressive prediction. Multiple key techniques have been introduced to mitigate iterative error accumulation while maintaining efficiency advantages during autoregressive field prediction. Extensive evaluations on three challenging photonic device simulation tasks have shown the superiority of our PIC2O-Sim method, showing 51.2% lower roll-out prediction error, 23.5 times fewer parameters than state-of-the-art neural operators, providing 300-600x higher simulation speed than an open-source FDTD numerical solver.">

We propose an extension of manifold-constrained Gaussian processes to conduct parameter inference for DDEs, whereas the time delay parameters have posed a challenge for existing methods that bypass numerical solvers. Our method uses a Bayesian framework to impose a Gaussian process model over the system trajectory, conditioned on the manifold constraint that satisfies the DDEs. For efficient computation, a linear interpolation scheme is developed to approximate the values of the time-delayed system outputs, along with corresponding theoretical error bounds on the approximated derivatives.

The PDE component focuses on reaction-diffusion processes, while the ODE component addresses transmission via ion channels on the cell's or organelle's membrane. However, analytically determining the underlying equations for ion channels is highly challenging due to the complexity and unknown factors inherent in biological processes. Therefore, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to model the open probability of ion channels, a task that can be intricate when approached with ODEs. This technique also reduces the number of unknowns required to model the open probability. When trained with valid data, the same neural network architecture can be used for different ion channels, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. Furthermore, based on the given data, we can build more physiologically reasonable DNN models that can be customized. Subsequently, we integrated the DNN model into calcium dynamics in neurons with endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a hybrid model that combines PDEs and DNNs. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the flexibility and advantages of the PDE-DNN model.">

For point-to-point motions, a neural Lyapunov function is proposed to align with the provided demonstrations. In the case of periodic motions, the neural Lyapunov function is used with the transversal contraction to ensure that all generated motions converge to a stable limit cycle. The model utilizes a streamlined neural network architecture, adept at achieving dual objectives: optimizing learning accuracy while maintaining global stability.

        <tr id="We investigate a Tikhonov regularization scheme specifically tailored for shallow neural networks within the context of solving a classic inverse problem: approximating an unknown function and its derivatives within a unit cubic domain based on noisy measurements. The proposed Tikhonov regularization scheme incorporates a penalty term that takes three distinct yet intricately related network (semi)norms: the extended Barron norm, the variation norm, and the Radon-BV seminorm. These choices of the penalty term are contingent upon the specific architecture of the neural network being utilized. We establish the connection between various network norms and particularly trace the dependence of the dimensionality index, aiming to deepen our understanding of how these norms interplay with each other. We revisit the universality of function approximation through various norms, establish rigorous error-bound analysis for the Tikhonov regularization scheme, and explicitly elucidate the dependency of the dimensionality index, providing a clearer understanding of how the dimensionality affects the approximation performance and how one designs a neural network with diverse approximating tasks.">

Especially in dynamical systems modeling, often two or more structures are combined to obtain a more powerful or efficient architecture regarding a specific application (area). Further, even physical simulations are combined with machine learning architectures, to increase prediction accuracy or optimize the computational performance. In this work, we shortly discuss, which types of models are usually combined and propose a model interface that is capable of expressing a width variety of mixed algebraic, discrete and differential equation based models. Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure. The contributions of this paper are highlighted at a proof of concept: Different connection topologies between two models are learned, interpreted and compared applying the proposed methodology and software implementation.">

        <tr id="We present a domain decomposition strategy for developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations from data when exact governing equations are unknown. On subdomains, trainable Whitney form elements are used to identify structure-preserving models from data, providing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which may be used to globally construct a mortar method. The reduced-order local elements may be trained offline to reproduce high-fidelity Dirichlet data in cases where first principles model derivation is either intractable, unknown, or computationally prohibitive. In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).">

While most previous studies focus on the inter-event dependencies and their representations, how individual events influence the overall dynamics over time has been under-explored. In this regime, we propose a Decoupled MTPP framework that disentangles characterization of a stochastic process into a set of evolving influences from different events. Our approach employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to learn flexible continuous dynamics of these influences while simultaneously addressing multiple inference problems, such as density estimation and survival rate computation. We emphasize the significance of disentangling the influences by comparing our framework with state-of-the-art methods on real-life datasets, and provide analysis on the model behavior for potential applications.">

Inference in this latent space amounts to standard Kalman filtering and smoothing. We realize these operations using parallel associative scanning, similar to Mamba, to obtain a principled, highly efficient, and scalable probabilistic SSM.

        <tr id="The research topic is: data-driven Bayesian state estimation with compressed measurement (BSCM) of model-free process, say for a (causal) tracking application. The dimension of the temporal measurement vector is lower than the dimension of the temporal state vector to be estimated. Hence the state estimation problem is an underdetermined inverse problem. The state-space-model (SSM) of the underlying dynamical process is assumed to be unknown and hence, we use the terminology 'model-free process'. In absence of the SSM, we can not employ traditional model-driven methods like Kalman Filter (KF) and Particle Filter (PF) and instead require data-driven methods. We first experimentally show that two existing unsupervised learning-based data-driven methods fail to address the BSCM problem for model-free process; they are data-driven nonlinear state estimation (DANSE) method and deep Markov model (DMM) method. The unsupervised learning uses unlabelled data comprised of only noisy measurements. While DANSE provides a good predictive performance to model the temporal measurement data as time-series, its unsupervised learning lacks a regularization for state estimation. We then investigate use of a semi-supervised learning approach, and develop a semi-supervised learning-based DANSE method, referred to as SemiDANSE. In the semi-supervised learning, we use a limited amount of labelled data along-with a large amount of unlabelled data, and that helps to bring the desired regularization for BSCM problem in the absence of SSM. The labelled data means pairwise measurement-and-state data. Using three chaotic dynamical systems (or processes) with nonlinear SSMs as benchmark, we show that the data-driven SemiDANSE provides competitive performance for BSCM against three SSM-informed methods - a hybrid method called KalmanNet, and two traditional model-driven methods called extended KF and unscented KF.">

Several works focus on computing or approximating Hessian diagonals, but even this simplification introduces significant additional costs compared to computing a gradient. In the absence of efficient exact computation schemes for Hessian diagonals, we revisit an early approximation scheme proposed by Becker and LeCun (1989, BL89), which has a cost similar to gradients and appears to have been overlooked by the community. We introduce HesScale, an improvement over BL89, which adds negligible extra computation. On small networks, we find that this improvement is of higher quality than all alternatives, even those with theoretical guarantees, such as unbiasedness, while being much cheaper to compute. We use this insight in reinforcement learning problems where small networks are used and demonstrate HesScale in second-order optimization and scaling the step-size parameter. In our experiments, HesScale optimizes faster than existing methods and improves stability through step-size scaling. These findings are promising for scaling second-order methods in larger models in the future.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models have been demonstrated as strong priors for solving general inverse problems. Most existing Diffusion model-based Inverse Problem Solvers (DIS) employ a plug-and-play approach to guide the sampling trajectory with either projections or gradients. Though effective, these methods generally necessitate hundreds of sampling steps, posing a dilemma between inference time and reconstruction quality. In this work, we try to push the boundary of inference steps to 1-2 NFEs while still maintaining high reconstruction quality. To achieve this, we propose to leverage a pretrained distillation of diffusion model, namely consistency model, as the data prior. The key to achieving few-step guidance is to enforce two types of constraints during the sampling process of the consistency model: soft measurement constraint with ControlNet and hard measurement constraint via optimization. Supporting both single-step reconstruction and multistep refinement, the proposed framework further provides a way to trade image quality with additional computational cost. Within comparable NFEs, our method achieves new state-of-the-art in diffusion-based inverse problem solving, showcasing the significant potential of employing prior-based inverse problem solvers for real-world applications.

 The Earth's subsurface structure provides critical insights into sustainable resource management and geologic evolution. The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method is an efficient data acquisition technique and can be used to image the underground resistivity structure with high spatial resolution. However, inversion of the increasingly huge volume of AEM data poses a heavy computational burden. In this study, we develop a hybrid deep learning-based approach by employing the physics-guided neural network (PGNN) which incorporates the governing physical laws into the loss function to solve the AEM inverse problem. The PGNN integrates the strength of data-driven method for representation learning with electromagnetic laws and allows for the underlying physical constraints to be strictly satisfied. We validate the effectiveness of our approach using both synthetic and field datasets. Compared with the classic Gauss-Newton method, our PGNN inversion system shows strong robustness against multiple noise sources and reduces the risk of being trapped in local extrema. Moreover, the PGNN-inverted results are physically more consistent with the AEM observations compared to the purely data-driven approach. Application to the field AEM data from Northern Australia demonstrates that the PGNN-based inversion framework effectively estimates the subsurface electrical properties with considerable lateral continuity and significantly higher efficiency, completing the inversion of more than 2734000 AEM soundings taking only minutes on a common PC. Our proposed PGNN-based method shows great promise for large-scale underground resistivity imaging, and the well-identified subsurface resistivity structure can effectively improve our understanding of resource distributions and geological hazards.">

Time-informed set (TIS) can provide the heuristic search domain to accelerate their convergence to the time-optimal solution.

To overcome these problems, we propose a method by leveraging deep learning technology, Koopman operator theory, and random set theory. Specifically, we propose a Deep Invertible Koopman operator with control U model named DIKU to predict states forward and backward over a long horizon by modifying the auxiliary network with an invertible neural network. A sampling-based approach, ASKU, performing reachability analysis for the DIKU is developed to approximate the TIS of nonlinear control systems online. Furthermore, we design an online time-informed SKMP using a direct sampling technique to draw uniform random samples in the TIS. Simulation experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing works, approximating TIS in near real-time and achieving superior planning performance in several time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning problems.">

For a wavepacket propagating in an anharmonic potential and for a tunneling system, we show that the FNO approach can accurately and faithfully model wavepacket propagation via the density. Additionally, we demonstrate that FNOs can be a suitable replacement for traditional TDSE solvers in cases where the results of the quantum dynamical simulation are required repeatedly such as in the case of parameter optimization problems (e.g., control). The speed-up from the FNO method allows for its combination with the Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach in applications that involve solving inverse problems such as optimal and coherent laser control of the outcome of dynamical processes.">

        <tr id="Echo state network (ESN) implements an alternative paradigm called reservoir computing to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where internal weights are randomly generated and kept fixed, and only readout weights need to be trained, which greatly reduces the training complexity of RNNs. ESN not only facilitates the practical implementation of RNNs but also shows superior performance over fully trained RNNs across a range of applications. However, the conventional ESN suffers from the drawbacks of stringent conditions for weight convergence and slow convergence speed. This paper proposes a memory regressor extended learning method to update the readout weights of ESNs. By constructing and incorporating a generalized prediction error based on regressor extension and filtering, the capacity of ESN to utilize historical data can be greatly improved. In the discrete-time domain, it is proven that exponential convergence of readout weights is achieved under a condition termed interval excitation that is strictly weaker than the classical condition of persistent excitation. Simulation results on modeling a 10th-order nonlinear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) system have revealed that the proposed approach accelerates weight convergence speed almost ten times higher compared to the conventional ESN.">

Our approach combines the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) approximation with convergence analysis in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) generated by NTK, aiming to provide a deep understanding of the convergence behavior of SGD in overparameterized two-layer neural networks. Our research framework enables us to explore the intricate interplay between kernel methods and optimization processes, shedding light on the optimization dynamics and convergence properties of neural networks. In this study, we establish sharp convergence rates for the last iterate of the SGD algorithm in overparameterized two-layer neural networks. Additionally, we have made significant advancements in relaxing the constraints on the number of neurons, which have been reduced from exponential dependence to polynomial dependence on the sample size or number of iterations. This improvement allows for more flexibility in the design and scaling of neural networks, and will deepen our theoretical understanding of neural network models trained with SGD.">

Traditional machine learning methods have advanced our ability to learn and predict such systems from observed time series data. However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

        <tr id="While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature learning only occurs with balanced initializations, where all layers learn at similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.">

        <tr id="Neural networks that can produce accurate, input-conditional uncertainty representations are critical for real-world applications. Recent progress on heteroscedastic continuous regression has shown great promise for calibrated uncertainty quantification on complex tasks, like image regression. However, when these methods are applied to discrete regression tasks, such as crowd counting, ratings prediction, or inventory estimation, they tend to produce predictive distributions with numerous pathologies. We propose to address these issues by training a neural network to output the parameters of a Double Poisson distribution, which we call the Deep Double Poisson Network (DDPN). In contrast to existing methods that are trained to minimize Gaussian negative log likelihood (NLL), DDPNs produce a proper probability mass function over discrete output. Additionally, DDPNs naturally model under-, over-, and equi-dispersion, unlike networks trained with the more rigid Poisson and Negative Binomial parameterizations. We show DDPNs 1) vastly outperform existing discrete models; 2) meet or exceed the accuracy and flexibility of networks trained with Gaussian NLL; 3) produce proper predictive distributions over discrete counts; and 4) exhibit superior out-of-distribution detection. DDPNs can easily be applied to a variety of count regression datasets including tabular, image, point cloud, and text data.">

 In this paper, we introduce the deep numerical technique DeepNM, which is designed for solving one-dimensional (1D) hyperbolic conservation laws, particularly wave equations. By creatively integrating traditional numerical schemes with deep learning techniques, the method yields improvements over conventional approaches. Specifically, we compare this approach against two established classical numerical methods: the Discontinuous Galerkin method (DG) and the Lax-Wendroff correction method (LWC). While maintaining a comparable level of accuracy, DeepNM significantly improves computational speed, surpassing conventional numerical methods in this aspect by more than tenfold, and reducing storage requirements by over 1000 times. Furthermore, DeepNM facilitates the utilization of higher-order numerical schemes and allows for an increased number of grid points, thereby enhancing precision. In contrast to the more prevalent PINN method, DeepNM optimally combines the strengths of conventional mathematical techniques with deep learning, resulting in heightened accuracy and expedited computations for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Notably, DeepNM introduces a novel research paradigm for numerical equation-solving that can be seamlessly integrated with various traditional numerical methods.">

        <tr id="Bayesian neural networks address epistemic uncertainty by learning a posterior distribution over model parameters. Sampling and weighting networks according to this posterior yields an ensemble model referred to as Bayes ensemble. Ensembles of neural networks (deep ensembles) can profit from the cancellation of errors effect: Errors by ensemble members may average out and the deep ensemble achieves better predictive performance than each individual network. We argue that neither the sampling nor the weighting in a Bayes ensemble are particularly well-suited for increasing generalization performance, as they do not support the cancellation of errors effect, which is evident in the limit from the Bernstein-von~Mises theorem for misspecified models. In contrast, a weighted average of models where the weights are optimized by minimizing a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound can improve generalization performance. This requires that the optimization takes correlations between models into account, which can be achieved by minimizing the tandem loss at the cost that hold-out data for estimating error correlations need to be available. The PAC-Bayesian weighting increases the robustness against correlated models and models with lower performance in an ensemble. This allows us to safely add several models from the same learning process to an ensemble, instead of using early-stopping for selecting a single weight configuration. Our study presents empirical results supporting these conceptual considerations on four different classification datasets. We show that state-of-the-art Bayes ensembles from the literature, despite being computationally demanding, do not improve over simple uniformly weighted deep ensembles and cannot match the performance of deep ensembles weighted by optimizing the tandem loss, which additionally come with non-vacuous generalization guarantees.">

Most existing techniques for constructing coarse-grained models feature ill-defined parameters whose values are arbitrarily chosen (e.g., a window size), are narrow in their applicability (e.g., only applicable to time series or spatial data), or cannot readily incorporate physics information. Here, we introduce the concept of physics-guided Gaussian process regression as a machine-learning-based coarse-graining technique that is broadly applicable and amenable to input from known physics-based relationships. Using a pair of case studies derived from molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate the attractive properties and superior performance of physics-guided Gaussian processes for coarse-graining relative to prevalent benchmarks.

Unfortunately, the online evaluation of these functions is restricted due to time and safety constraints in most cases. In offline model-based optimization (MBO), we aim to find a design that maximizes the target function using only a pre-existing offline dataset. While prior methods consider forward or inverse approaches to address the problem, these approaches are limited by conservatism and the difficulty of learning highly multi-modal mappings. Recently, there has been an emerging paradigm of learning to improve solutions with synthetic trajectories constructed from the offline dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel conditional generative modeling approach to produce trajectories toward high-scoring regions. First, we construct synthetic trajectories toward high-scoring regions using the dataset while injecting locality bias for consistent improvement directions. Then, we train a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories conditioned on their scores. Lastly, we sample multiple trajectories from the trained model with guidance to explore high-scoring regions beyond the dataset and select high-fidelity designs among generated trajectories with the proxy function. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive baselines on Design-Bench and its practical variants.

The core enabler is a physics-based modeling framework that generates a multitude of synthetic data to align the LLM to a physically consistent initial state before finetuning.

In computer-aided engineering (CAE), the ability to handle fine resolutions and large computational models is essential for improving product performance and reducing development costs.

In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm for solving second-order linear PDEs of non-conservative systems with spatially varying parameters, using the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation (LCHS) method. Our approach transforms those PDEs into ordinary differential equations represented by qubit operators, through spatial discretization using the finite difference method. Then, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs the operator corresponding to the spatially varying parameters of PDEs via a logic minimization technique, which reduces the number of terms and subsequently the circuit depth. We also develop a scalable method for realizing a quantum circuit for LCHS, using a tensor-network-based technique, specifically a matrix product state (MPS). We validate our method with applications to the acoustic equation with spatially varying parameters and the dissipative heat equation. Our approach includes a detailed recipe for constructing quantum circuits for PDEs, leveraging efficient encoding of spatially varying parameters of PDEs and scalable implementation of LCHS, which we believe marks a significant step towards advancing quantum computing's role in solving practical engineering problems.">

 We present a tensor-based method for model selection which identifies the unknown partial differential equation that governs a dynamical system using only spatiotemporal measurements. The method circumvents a disadvantage of standard matrix-based methods which typically have large storage consumption. Using a recently developed multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems, we collect the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the measured data and construct a low-rank dictionary tensor in the tensor-train format. A tensor-based linear regression problem is then built, which balances the learning accuracy, model complexity, and computational efficiency. An algebraic expression of the unknown equations can be extracted. Numerical results are demonstrated on datasets generated by the wave equation, the Burgers' equation, and a few parametric partial differential equations.">

We are now situated within a novel epoch wherein the scientific research paradigm is increasingly shaped by the preeminence of large-scale data and artificial intelligence, particularly within the realm of AI for science applications. The advent of high-energy colliders coupled with Monte Carlo simulations has given rise to an unprecedented accumulation of data. Nested within this transformative research paradigm, machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies have been extensively harnessed for the analysis of these vast data sets. Within the domain of high-energy nuclear physics, two prevalent machine learning techniques have emerged: Bayesian analysis and deep learning. The former employs comprehensive fitting methodologies that compare extensive data sets against theoretical models, enabling the extraction of critical information pertaining to the initial nuclear structure, parton distributions, the equation of state governing hot and dense nuclear matter, and the transport coefficients of the quark–gluon plasma, among other parameters. Conversely, the latter capitalizes on the unparalleled pattern recognition capabilities of deep learning to discern robust features from high-dimensional raw data, specifically targeting individual physical parameters.

        <tr id="A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

While methods like sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) reduce computational requirements in these settings, the underlying approximations result in suboptimal data acquisitions that slow the progress of optimization. In this paper we modify SVGPs to better align with the goals of BO: targeting informed data acquisition rather than global posterior fidelity. Using the framework of utility-calibrated variational inference, we unify GP approximation and data acquisition into a joint optimization problem, thereby ensuring optimal decisions under a limited computational budget. Our approach can be used with any decision-theoretic acquisition function and is compatible with trust region methods like TuRBO. We derive efficient joint objectives for the expected improvement and knowledge gradient acquisition functions in both the standard and batch BO settings. Our approach outperforms standard SVGPs on high-dimensional benchmark tasks in control and molecular design.">

However, the filtering distribution is generally intractable to obtain for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Filters used in practice, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), are biased for nonlinear systems and have numerous tuning parameters. Here, we present a framework for learning a parameterized analysis map-the map that takes a forecast distribution and observations to the filtering distribution-using variational inference. We show that this methodology can be used to learn gain matrices for filtering linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as inflation and localization parameters for an EnKF. Future work will apply this framework to learn new filtering algorithms.">

        <tr id="Reducing the reliance on intrusive flow probes is a critical task in active flow control based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Although a scarcity of flow data captured by probes adversely impacts the control proficiency of the DRL agent, leading to suboptimal flow modulation, minimizing the use of redundant probes significantly reduces the overall implementation costs, making the control strategy more economically viable. In this paper, we propose an active flow control method based on physics-informed DRL. This method integrates a physics-informed neural network into the DRL framework, harnessing the inherent physical characteristics of the flow field using strategically placed probes. We analyze the impact of probe placement, probe quantity, and DRL agent sampling strategies on the fidelity of flow predictions and the efficacy of flow control. Using the wake control of a two-dimensional cylinder flow with a Reynolds number of 100 as a case study, we position a specific number of flow probes within the flow field to gather pertinent information. When benchmarked against traditional DRL techniques, the results are unequivocal: in terms of training efficiency, physics-informed DRL reduces the training cycle by up to 30 rounds. Furthermore, by decreasing the number of flow probes in the flow field from 164 to just 4, the physics-based DRL achieves superior drag reduction through more precise control. Notably, compared to traditional DRL control, the drag reduction effect is enhanced by a significant 6%.">

However, as both the input and output streams of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore, the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.">

Although they have demonstrated powerful fitting and predicting, most existing models are only built to learn single-system dynamics. Several advanced researches have considered learning dynamics across environments, which can exploit the potential commonalities among the dynamics across environments and adapt to new environments. However, these methods still are prone to scarcity problems where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Therefore, we propose a novel CoNDP (Context-Informed Neural ODE Processes) to achieve learning system dynamics from sparse observations across environments. It can fully use contextual information of each environment to better capture the intrinsic commonalities across environments and distinguishable differences among environments while modeling uncertainty of system evolution, producing more accurate predictions. Intensive experiments are conducted on five complex dynamical systems in various fields. Results show that the proposed CoNDP can achieve optimal results compared with common neural simulators and state-of-the-art cross-environmental models.">

Inspired by the advances in nonlinear ICA, we propose a state-space modeling framework in which we can identify not just the latent states but also the unknown transition function that maps the past states to the present. We introduce a practical algorithm based on variational auto-encoders and empirically demonstrate in realistic synthetic settings that we can (i) recover latent state dynamics with high accuracy, (ii) correspondingly achieve high future prediction accuracy, and (iii) adapt fast to new environments.">

Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the"Step Truncation TT-Newton"method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples.

In particular, we first propose Physics-Cross-Attention (PhCA) transforming representation from the geometric space to the latent space, then learn the operator in the latent space, and finally recover the real-world geometric space via the inverse PhCA map. Our model retains flexibility that can decode values in any position not limited to locations defined in training set, and therefore can naturally perform interpolation and extrapolation tasks particularly useful for inverse problems. Moreover, the proposed LNO improves in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

        <tr id="A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those in applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties in handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertain systems, which are more and more common in engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared in different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods in a concise manner in an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described in detail. We describe three main concepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths in applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design.">

        <tr id="In this work, we explore finite-dimensional linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems by restricting the Koopman operator to an invariant subspace spanned by specially chosen observable functions. The Koopman operator is an infinite-dimensional linear operator that evolves functions of the state of a dynamical system. Dominant terms in the Koopman expansion are typically computed using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). DMD uses linear measurements of the state variables, and it has recently been shown that this may be too restrictive for nonlinear systems. Choosing the right nonlinear observable functions to form an invariant subspace where it is possible to obtain linear reduced-order models, especially those that are useful for control, is an open challenge. Here, we investigate the choice of observable functions for Koopman analysis that enable the use of optimal linear control techniques on nonlinear problems. First, to include a cost on the state of the system, as in linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control, it is helpful to include these states in the observable subspace, as in DMD. However, we find that this is only possible when there is a single isolated fixed point, as systems with multiple fixed points or more complicated attractors are not globally topologically conjugate to a finite-dimensional linear system, and cannot be represented by a finite-dimensional linear Koopman subspace that includes the state. We then present a data-driven strategy to identify relevant observable functions for Koopman analysis by leveraging a new algorithm to determine relevant terms in a dynamical system by ℓ1-regularized regression of the data in a nonlinear function space; we also show how this algorithm is related to DMD. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of nonlinear observable subspaces in the design of Koopman operator optimal control laws for fully nonlinear systems using techniques from linear optimal control.">

        <tr id="We develop a deep autoencoder architecture that can be used to find a coordinate transformation which turns a non-linear partial differential equation (PDE) into a linear PDE. Our architecture is motivated by the linearising transformations provided by the Cole–Hopf transform for Burgers’ equation and the inverse scattering transform for completely integrable PDEs. By leveraging a residual network architecture, a near-identity transformation can be exploited to encode intrinsic coordinates in which the dynamics are linear. The resulting dynamics are given by a Koopman operator matrix K. The decoder allows us to transform back to the original coordinates as well. Multiple time step prediction can be performed by repeated multiplication by the matrix K in the intrinsic coordinates. We demonstrate our method on a number of examples, including the heat equation and Burgers’ equation, as well as the substantially more challenging Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, showing that our method provides a robust architecture for discovering linearising transforms for non-linear PDEs.">

        <tr id="We propose spectral methods for long-term forecasting of temporal signals stemming from linear and nonlinear quasi-periodic dynamical systems. For linear signals, we introduce an algorithm with similarities to the Fourier transform but which does not rely on periodicity assumptions, allowing for forecasting given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The optimization objective for both algorithms is highly non-convex. However, expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global optima of the error surface in a scalable and efficient manner, partially by exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis, uncertainty quantification metrics are a natural byproduct of the spectral forecasting methods. We extensively benchmark these algorithms against other leading forecasting methods on a range of synthetic experiments as well as in the context of real-world power systems and fluid flows.">

        <tr id="The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its variants, such as extended DMD (EDMD), are broadly used to fit simple linear models to dynamical systems known from observable data. As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.">

        <tr id="Dynamical systems provide a comprehensive way to study complex and changing behaviors across various sciences. Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.">

        <tr id="The Koopman operator enables the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems through a linear perspective by describing time evolution in the infinite-dimensional space of observables. Here this formalism is applied to shear flows, specifically the minimal flow unit plane Couette flow and a nine-dimensional model of turbulent shear flow between infinite parallel free-slip walls under a sinusoidal body force (Moehlis et al., New J. Phys. 6, 56 (2004)). We identify a finite set of observables and approximate the Koopman operator using neural networks, following the method developed by Constante-Amores et al., Chaos, 34(4), 043119 (2024). Then the time evolution is determined with a method here denoted as"Projected Koopman Dynamics". Using a high-dimensional approximate Koopman operator directly for the plane Couette system is computationally infeasible due to the high state space dimension of direct numerical simulations (DNS). However, the long-term dynamics of the dissipative Navier-Stokes equations are expected to live on a lower-dimensional invariant manifold. Motivated by this fact, we perform dimension reduction on the DNS data with a variant of the IRMAE-WD (implicit rank-minimizing autoencoder-weight decay) autoencoder (Zeng et al., MLST 5(2), 025053 (2024)) before applying the Koopman approach. We compare the performance of data-driven state space (neural ordinary differential equation) and Projected Koopman Dynamics approaches in manifold coordinates for plane Couette flow. Projected Koopman Dynamics effectively captures the chaotic behavior of Couette flow and the nine-dimensional model, excelling in both short-term tracking and long-term statistical analysis, outperforming other frameworks applied to these shear flows.">

In this paper, we address the resolvent of a Koopman operator for a nonlinear autonomous discrete-time system, which we call the Koopman resolvent, and its identification problem. First, we show that for the nonlinear system with a scalar-valued output, the $z$- transform of the output is represented by the action of Koop-man resolvent. Second, we describe an identification method of the Koopman resolvent directly from time-series data of the output, in which we estimate parameters of the resolvent as well as poles and residues of the z-transform of the output. By combining the so-called frequency-domain Prony method with the Vandermonde-Cauchy form in the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), we propose the method which we call the frequency-domain DMD, in which all the unknowns can be estimated in the frequency domain.">

        <tr id="This paper considers the data-driven stabilization of linear boundary controlled parabolic PDEs by making use of the Koopman operator. For this, a Koopman eigenstructure assignment problem is solved, which amounts to determine a feedback of the Koopman open-loop eigenfunctionals assigning a desired finite set of closed-loop Koopman eigenvalues and eigenfunctionals to the closed-loop system. It is shown that the designed controller only needs a finite number of open-loop Koopman eigenvalues and modes of the state. They are determined by extending the classical Krylov-DMD to parabolic systems. For this, only a finite number of pointlike outputs and their temporal samples as well as temporal samples of the inputs are required resulting in a data-driven solution of the eigenstructure assignment problem. Exponential stability of the closed-loop system in the presence of small Krylov-DMD errors is verified. An unstable diffusion-reaction system demonstrates the new data-driven controller design technique for distributed-parameter systems.">

        <tr id="We introduce a method for constructing reduced-order models directly from videos of dynamical systems. The method uses a non-intrusive tracking to isolate the motion of a user-selected part in the video of an autonomous dynamical system. In the space of delayed observations of this motion, we reconstruct a low-dimensional attracting spectral submanifold (SSM) whose internal dynamics serves as a mathematically justified reduced-order model for nearby motions of the full system. We obtain this model in a simple polynomial form that allows explicit identification of important physical system parameters, such as natural frequencies, linear and nonlinear damping and nonlinear stiffness. Beyond faithfully reproducing attracting steady states and limit cycles, our SSM-reduced models can also uncover hidden motion not seen in the video, such as unstable fixed points and unstable limit cycles forming basin boundaries. We demonstrate all these features on experimental videos of five physical systems: a double pendulum, an inverted flag in counter-flow, water sloshing in tank, a wing exhibiting aeroelastic flutter and a shimmying wheel.">

We address limitations of previous work on data-driven flow map learning in the sense that we focus on noisy and limited data to move toward data collection scenarios in real-world applications. Leveraging recent work on modeling PDEs in modal and nodal spaces, we present a neural network structure that is suitable for PDE modeling with noisy and limited data available only on a subset of the state variables or computational domain. In particular, spatial grid-point measurements are reduced using a learned linear transformation, after which the dynamics are learned in this reduced basis before being transformed back out to the nodal space. This approach yields a drastically reduced parameterization of the neural network compared with previous flow map models for nodal space learning. This primarily allows for smaller training data sets, but also enables reduced training times.">

However, they often rely on strong modeling assumptions and expensive numerical integration, requiring significant computational resources and domain expertise.

Furthermore, its predictions may disobey the governing physical laws and are difficult to interpret. Physics-guided DL aims to integrate first-principled physical knowledge into data-driven methods. It has the best of both worlds and is well equipped to better solve scientific problems. Recently, this field has gained great progress and has drawn considerable interest across discipline Here, we introduce the framework of physics-guided DL with a special emphasis on learning dynamical systems.

        <tr id="When neural networks are trained from data to simulate the dynamics of physical systems, they encounter a persistent challenge: the long-time dynamics they produce are often unphysical or unstable. We analyze the origin of such instabilities when learning linear dynamical systems, focusing on the training dynamics. We make several analytical findings which empirical observations suggest extend to nonlinear dynamical systems. First, the rate of convergence of the training dynamics is uneven and depends on the distribution of energy in the data. As a special case, the dynamics in directions where the data have no energy cannot be learned. Second, in the unlearnable directions, the dynamics produced by the neural network depend on the weight initialization, and common weight initialization schemes can produce unstable dynamics. Third, injecting synthetic noise into the data during training adds damping to the training dynamics and can stabilize the learned simulator, though doing so undesirably biases the learned dynamics. For each contributor to instability, we suggest mitigative strategies. We also highlight important differences between learning discrete-time and continuous-time dynamics, and discuss extensions to nonlinear systems.">

        <tr id="The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known, typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions. In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional, noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical system for the R\"ossler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.">

        <tr id="Stability is a basic requirement when studying the behavior of dynamical systems. However, stabilizing dynamical systems via reinforcement learning is challenging because only little data can be collected over short time horizons before instabilities are triggered and data become meaningless. This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach that is formulated over latent manifolds of unstable dynamics so that stabilizing policies can be trained from few data samples. The unstable manifolds are minimal in the sense that they contain the lowest dimensional dynamics that are necessary for learning policies that guarantee stabilization. This is in stark contrast to generic latent manifolds that aim to approximate all -- stable and unstable -- system dynamics and thus are higher dimensional and often require higher amounts of data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes even complex physical systems from few data samples for which other methods that operate either directly in the system state space or on generic latent manifolds fail.">

This discrepancy can complicate the design of cost functions and constraints for a model predictive controller.

        <tr id="Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control this latent activity would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. Employing techniques from the field of optimal control, we simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. With a data-driven latent dynamics model, we apply model predictive control (MPC) to provide anticipatory, optimal control over the trajectory of the circuit in a latent space. We are able to control the latent dynamics of the SNN to follow several reference trajectories despite observing only a subset of neurons and with a substantial amount of unknown noise injected into the network. These results provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and other variables of interest such as organismal behavior and BCI performance.">

        <tr id="Enhancing the sparsity of data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) has gained increasing attention in recent years. In this work, we analyze an efficient approach to identifying skillful ROMs with a sparse structure using an information-theoretic indicator called causation entropy. The causation entropy quantifies in a statistical way the additional contribution of each term to the underlying dynamics beyond the information already captured by all the other terms in the ansatz. By doing so, the causation entropy assesses the importance of each term to the dynamics before a parameter estimation procedure is performed. Thus, the approach can be utilized to eliminate terms with little dynamic impact, leading to a parsimonious structure that retains the essential physics. To circumvent the difficulty of estimating high-dimensional probability density functions (PDFs) involved in the causation entropy computation, we leverage Gaussian approximations for such PDFs, which are demonstrated to be sufficient even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian dynamics.

        <tr id="This study presents the extension of the data-driven optimal prediction approach to the dynamical system with control. The optimal prediction is used to analyze dynamical systems in which the states consist of resolved and unresolved variables. The latter variables can not be measured explicitly. They may have smaller amplitudes and affect the resolved variables that can be measured. The optimal prediction approach recovers the averaged trajectories of the resolved variables by computing conditional expectations, while the distribution of the unresolved variables is assumed to be known. We consider such dynamical systems and introduce their additional control functions. To predict the targeted trajectories numerically, we develop a data-driven method based on the dynamic mode decomposition. The proposed approach takes the $\mathit{measured}$ trajectories of the resolved variables, constructs an approximate linear operator from the Mori-Zwanzig decomposition, and reconstructs the $\mathit{averaged}$ trajectories of the same variables. It is demonstrated that the method is much faster than the Monte Carlo simulations and it provides a reliable prediction. We experimentally confirm the efficacy of the proposed method for two Hamiltonian dynamical systems.">

        <tr id="This paper presents a sequence of two approaches for the data-driven control-oriented modeling of networked systems, i.e., the systems that involve many interacting dynamical components. First, a novel deep learning approach named the weak Latent Dynamics Model (wLDM) is developed for learning generic nonlinear dynamics with control. Leveraging the weak form, the wLDM enables more numerically stable and computationally efficient training as well as more accurate prediction, when compared to conventional methods such as neural ordinary differential equations. Building upon the wLDM framework, we propose the weak Graph Koopman Bilinear Form (wGKBF) model, which integrates geometric deep learning and Koopman theory to learn latent space dynamics for networked systems, especially for the challenging cases having multiple timescales. The effectiveness of the wLDM framework and wGKBF model are demonstrated on three example systems of increasing complexity - a controlled double pendulum, the stiff Brusselator dynamics, and an electrified aircraft energy system. These numerical examples show that the wLDM and wGKBF achieve superior predictive accuracy and training efficiency as compared to baseline models. Parametric studies provide insights into the effects of hyperparameters in the weak form. The proposed framework shows the capability to efficiently capture control-dependent dynamics in these systems, including stiff dynamics and multi-physics interactions, offering a promising direction for learning control-oriented models of complex networked systems.">

Learning must be performed while enforcing the numerical stability of the learned model, the existing knowledge within an informed or augmented setting, or by taking into account the multiscale dynamics—for both linear and nonlinear dynamics. However, when the final objective of such a learned dynamical system is to be used for control purposes, learning transformed dynamics can be advantageous. Therefore, many alternatives exists, and the present paper focuses on two of them: the first based on the discovery and use of the so-called flat control and the second one based on the use of the Koopman theory. The main contributions when addressing the first is the discovery of the flat output transformation by using an original neural framework. Moreover, when using the Koopman theory, this paper proposes an original procedure for learning parametric dynamics in the latent space, which is of particular interest in control-based engineering applications.">

        <tr id="Given the complexity and nonlinearity inherent in traffic dynamics within vehicular platoons, there exists a critical need for a modeling methodology with high accuracy while concurrently achieving physical analyzability. Currently, there are two predominant approaches: the physics model-based approach and the Artificial Intelligence (AI)--based approach. Knowing the facts that the physical-based model usually lacks sufficient modeling accuracy and potential function mismatches and the pure-AI-based method lacks analyzability, this paper innovatively proposes an AI-based Koopman approach to model the unknown nonlinear platoon dynamics harnessing the power of AI and simultaneously maintain physical analyzability, with a particular focus on periods of traffic oscillation. Specifically, this research first employs a deep learning framework to generate the embedding function that lifts the original space into the embedding space. Given the embedding space descriptiveness, the platoon dynamics can be expressed as a linear dynamical system founded by the Koopman theory. Based on that, the routine of linear dynamical system analysis can be conducted on the learned traffic linear dynamics in the embedding space. By that, the physical interpretability and analyzability of model-based methods with the heightened precision inherent in data-driven approaches can be synergized. Comparative experiments have been conducted with existing modeling approaches, which suggests our method's superiority in accuracy. Additionally, a phase plane analysis is performed, further evidencing our approach's effectiveness in replicating the complex dynamic patterns. Moreover, the proposed methodology is proven to feature the capability of analyzing the stability, attesting to the physical analyzability.">

Neural operators are deep neural networks designed to learn nontrivial solution operators of such differential equations from data. As for all statistical models, the predictions of these models are imperfect and exhibit errors. Such errors are particularly difficult to spot in the complex nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems. We introduce a new framework for approximate Bayesian uncertainty quantification in neural operators using function-valued Gaussian processes. Our approach can be interpreted as a probabilistic analogue of the concept of currying from functional programming and provides a practical yet theoretically sound way to apply the linearized Laplace approximation to neural operators. In a case study on Fourier neural operators, we show that, even for a discretized input, our method yields a Gaussian closure--a structured Gaussian process posterior capturing the uncertainty in the output function of the neural operator, which can be evaluated at an arbitrary set of points. The method adds minimal prediction overhead, can be applied post-hoc without retraining the neural operator, and scales to large models and datasets. We showcase the efficacy of our approach through applications to different types of partial differential equations.">

These models are shown to be highly efficient and robust.

        <tr id="This paper presents an identification method for the transient dynamics of microgrids that exploits the intrinsic geometric structure of the dynamics, i.e., the high-dimensional states reside on a relatively low-dimensional manifold. In terms of discrete-time dynamics, the increment in states is decomposed into the tangent and normal components using the local geometric information, inferred from the data set of dynamical responses. The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) method and generalized moving least square (GMLS) algorithms are used to estimate the tangent and normal components of increments, respectively, at every time step to constrain the solution onto the manifold of dynamics; this reduces the sensitivity of the SINDy model to candidate function selection and improve the prediction performance. A ten-bus microgrid system with five loads is used to test and verify the effectiveness of the presented method in identifying the system’s nonlinear dynamics. Numerical tests show that the developed method can give a better estimation for the dynamic transients caused by load variation, when compared to the traditional SINDy model. The results imply that the proposed method is a useful tool to model the transient dynamics in power systems, especially when the state space lies on a low-dimensional manifold.">

The majority of dynamical systems arising from applications show a chaotic character. This is especially true for climate and weather applications. We present here an application of Koopman operator theory to tropical and global SST that yields an approximation to the continuous spectrum typical of these situations. We also show that the Koopman modes yield a decomposition of the data sets that can be used to categorize the variability. Most relevant modes emerge naturally and they can be identified easily. A difference with other analysis methods such as EOF or Fourier expansion is that the Koopman modes have a dynamical interpretation thanks to their connection to the Koopman operator and they are not constrained in their shape by special requirements such as orthogonality (as it is the case for EOF) or pure periodicity (as in the case of Fourier expansions). The pure periodic modes emerge naturally and they form a subspace that can be interpreted as the limiting subspace for the variability. The stationary states therefore are the scaffolding around which the dynamics takes place. The modes can also be traced to the NINO variability and in the case of the global SST to the PDO.">

More recent data-driven techniques use neural networks to enable nonlinear projections. Whilst those often enable stronger compression, they may have redundant parameters and lead to suboptimal latent dimensionality. To overcome these, we propose a multistep algorithm that induces sparsity in the encoder-decoder networks for effective reduction in the number of parameters and additional compression of the latent space. This algorithm starts with sparsely initialized a network and training it using linearized Bregman iterations. These iterations have been very successful in computer vision and compressed sensing tasks, but have not yet been used for reduced-order modelling. After the training, we further compress the latent space dimensionality by using a form of proper orthogonal decomposition. Last, we use a bias propagation technique to change the induced sparsity into an effective reduction of parameters. We apply this algorithm to three representative PDE models: 1D diffusion, 1D advection, and 2D reaction-diffusion. Compared to conventional training methods like Adam, the proposed method achieves similar accuracy with 30% less parameters and a significantly smaller latent space.">

Our data-driven methodology simultaneously approximates the PF operator to perform prediction of the evolution of the agents and also predicts the terminal probability density of AI agents, such as robotic systems and generative models.

We propose a framework for learning from biased simulations rooted in the infinitesimal generator of the process and the associated resolvent operator. We contrast our approach to more common ones based on the transfer operator, showing that it can provably learn the spectral properties of the unbiased system from biased data. In experiments, we highlight the advantages of our method over transfer operator approaches and recent developments based on generator learning, demonstrating its effectiveness in estimating eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.

        <tr id="In order to extract governing equations from time-series data, various approaches are proposed. Among those, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) stands out as a successful method capable of modeling governing equations with a minimal number of terms, utilizing the principles of compressive sensing. This feature, which relies on a small number of terms, is crucial for interpretability. The effectiveness of SINDy hinges on the choice of candidate functions within its dictionary to extract governing equations of dynamical systems. A larger dictionary allows for more terms, enhancing the quality of approximations. However, the computational complexity scales with dictionary size, rendering SINDy less suitable for high-dimensional datasets, even though it has been successfully applied to low-dimensional datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce iterative SINDy in this paper, where the dictionary undergoes expansion and compression through iterations. We also conduct an analysis of the convergence properties of iterative SINDy. Simulation results validate that iterative SINDy can achieve nearly identical performance to SINDy, while significantly reducing computational complexity. Notably, iterative SINDy demonstrates effectiveness with high-dimensional time-series data without incurring the prohibitively high computational cost associated with SINDy.">

This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic properties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or invariant measure. One of the major theoretical challenges for numerical methods is that approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient to approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of representing a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as a Markov process. The procedure is completely data-driven. The technique is proved to be convergent -- the stationary density of the Markov process has a support that converges to the targeted invariant set. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with complicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under further assumptions of stochastic stability of the targeted system, the technique is also shown to provide a convergent statistical approximation.">

Their success in modeling nonlocal, long-range correlations has led to their widespread adoption in natural language processing, computer vision, and time-series problems. Neural operators, which map spaces of functions into spaces of functions, are necessarily both nonlinear and nonlocal if they are universal; it is thus natural to ask whether the attention mechanism can be used in the design of neural operators. Motivated by this, we study transformers in the function space setting. We formulate attention as a map between infinite dimensional function spaces and prove that the attention mechanism as implemented in practice is a Monte Carlo or finite difference approximation of this operator. The function space formulation allows for the design of transformer neural operators, a class of architectures designed to learn mappings between function spaces, for which we prove a universal approximation result. The prohibitive cost of applying the attention operator to functions defined on multi-dimensional domains leads to the need for more efficient attention-based architectures. For this reason we also introduce a function space generalization of the patching strategy from computer vision, and introduce a class of associated neural operators. Numerical results, on an array of operator learning problems, demonstrate the promise of our approaches to function space formulations of attention and their use in neural operators.">

        <tr id="The quasipotential function allows for comprehension and prediction of the escape mechanisms from metastable states in nonlinear dynamical systems. This function acts as a natural extension of the potential function for non-gradient systems and it unveils important properties such as the maximum likelihood transition paths, transition rates and expected exit times of the system. Here, we leverage on machine learning via the combination of two data-driven techniques, namely a neural network and a sparse regression algorithm, to obtain symbolic expressions of quasipotential functions. The key idea is first to determine an orthogonal decomposition of the vector field that governs the underlying dynamics using neural networks, then to interpret symbolically the downhill and circulatory components of the decomposition. These functions are regressed simultaneously with the addition of mathematical constraints. We show that our approach discovers a parsimonious quasipotential equation for an archetypal model with a known exact quasipotential and for the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator. The analytical forms deliver direct access to the stability of the metastable states and predict rare events with significant computational advantages. Our data-driven approach is of interest for a wide range of applications in which to assess the fluctuating dynamics.">

NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some"optimal"coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.">

Since formulating governing expressions from first principles can be difficult, it is of particular interest to identify expressions for iterated maps given only their data streams. In this work, we consider a modified Symbolic Artificial Neural Network-Trained Expressions (SymANNTEx) architecture for this task, an architecture more expressive than others in the literature. We make a modification to the model pipeline to optimize the regression, then characterize the behavior of the adjusted model in identifying several classical chaotic maps. With the goal of parsimony, sparsity-inducing weight regularization and information theory-informed simplification are implemented. We show that our modified SymANNTEx model properly identifies single-state maps and achieves moderate success in approximating a dual-state attractor.

When a sufficient amount of such I/O data are available, our method is capable of learning the unknown dynamics and producing an accurate predictive model for the stochastic responses of the system subject to arbitrary excitation signals not in the training data. Our method has two key components: (1) a local approximation of the training I/O data to transfer the learning into a parameterized form; and (2) a generative model to approximate the underlying unknown stochastic flow map in distribution.

However, it remains challenging to handle noisy data. To enhance robustness against noise, we incorporate the weak-form estimation of nonlinear dynamics (WENDy) into gLaSDI. In the proposed weak-form gLaSDI (WgLaSDI) framework, an autoencoder and WENDy are trained simultaneously to discover intrinsic nonlinear latent-space dynamics of high-dimensional data. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) employed in gLaSDI, WENDy enables variance reduction and robust latent space discovery, therefore leading to more accurate and efficient reduced-order modeling. Furthermore, the greedy physics-informed active learning in WgLaSDI enables adaptive sampling of optimal training data on the fly for enhanced modeling accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated by modeling various nonlinear dynamical problems, including viscous and inviscid Burgers' equations, time-dependent radial advection, and the Vlasov equation for plasma physics. With data that contains 5-10% Gaussian white noise, WgLaSDI outperforms gLaSDI by orders of magnitude, achieving 1-7% relative errors. Compared with the high-fidelity models, WgLaSDI achieves 121 to 1,779x speed-up.">

Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method (FEM), suffer from long run times and large memory consumption. On the other hand, approaches based on graph neural networks are faster but still suffer from long computation times on dense graphs, which are often required for high-fidelity simulations. Our model, GIOROM or Graph Interaction Operator for Reduced-Order Modeling, learns temporal dynamics within a reduced-order setting, capturing spatial features from a highly sparse graph representation of the input and generalizing to arbitrary spatial locations during inference. The model is geometry-aware and discretization-agnostic and can generalize to different initial conditions, velocities, and geometries after training. We show that point clouds of the order of 100,000 points can be inferred from sparse graphs with $\sim$1000 points, with negligible change in computation time. We empirically evaluate our model on elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, Non-Newtonian fluids, Drucker-Prager granular flows, and von Mises elastoplasticity. On these benchmarks, our approach results in a 25$\times$ speedup compared to other neural network-based physics simulators while delivering high-fidelity predictions of complex physical systems and showing better performance on most benchmarks.

This repeated evaluation of frequency data requires repeated full model computations and may not be feasible. The data-informativity framework for moment matching provides a method for obtaining such frequency data from a single time-domain simulation. However, this framework usually requires solving linear systems with prohibitively ill-conditioned matrices, especially when recovering frequency data from off the unit circle as required for optimality. In this paper, building upon our previous work with the data informativity framework for moment matching, we provide a formula for the nonzero extreme eigenvalues of a symmetric rank-$1$ perturbation to an orthogonal projection, which then leads to an optimal scaling of the aforementioned linear systems. We also establish connections between the underlying dynamical system and conditioning of these linear systems. This analysis then leads to our algorithmic development, time-domain IRKA, which allows us to implement a time-domain variant of TF-IRKA, constructing $\mathcal H_2$ optimal DDROMs from a single time-domain simulation without requiring repeated frequency data evaluations.

For, we first demonstrate that the estimation of the moment can be improved via tuning the regularization term, and further, we show under which condition the effect of the transient improves the performance of the estimation. Then, we construct a parameterized model characterized by a kernel-based output mapping. Finally, the proposed data-driven approach is validated and discussed by means of a DC-to-DC Cuk converter driven by a Van der Pol oscillator.">

In this work, we study the learning dynamics of linear SSMs to understand how covariance structure in data, latent state size, and initialization affect the evolution of parameters throughout learning with gradient descent. We show that focusing on the learning dynamics in the frequency domain affords analytical solutions under mild assumptions, and we establish a link between one-dimensional SSMs and the dynamics of deep linear feed-forward networks. Finally, we analyze how latent state over-parameterization affects convergence time and describe future work in extending our results to the study of deep SSMs with nonlinear connections.

By adopting a geometric viewpoint, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of how various ``complete parameterization'' -- referring to the policy parameters together with its Riemannian geometry -- of control design problems, influence stability and performance of local search algorithms. The paper is structured to address key themes such as policy parameterization, the topology and geometry of stabilizing policies, and their implications for various (non-convex) dynamic performance measures. We focus on a few iconic control design problems, including the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, and $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. In particular, we first discuss the topology and Riemannian geometry of stabilizing policies, distinguishing between their static and dynamic realizations. Expanding on this geometric perspective, we then explore structural properties of the aforementioned performance measures and their interplay with the geometry of stabilizing policies in presence of policy constraints; along the way, we address issues such as spurious stationary points, symmetries of dynamic feedback policies, and (non-)smoothness of the corresponding performance measures. We conclude the survey with algorithmic implications of policy optimization in feedback design.">

New neural network architectures are proposed to effectively learn the key dynamical mechanisms including the multiscale coupling and strong instability, and gain robust skill for long-time prediction resistive to the accumulated model errors from the data-driven approximation. The machine learning model overcomes the inherent limitations in traditional long short-time memory networks by exploiting a conditional Gaussian structure informed of the essential physical dynamics. The model performance is demonstrated under a prototype model from idealized geophysical flow and passive tracers, which exhibits analytical solutions with representative statistical features. Many attractive properties are found in the trained model in recovering the hidden dynamics using a limited dataset and sparse observation time, showing uniformly high skill with persistent numerical stability in predicting both the trajectory and statistical solutions among different statistical regimes away from the training regime. The model framework is promising to be applied to a wider class of turbulent systems with complex structures.">

Training these models is classically a data-fitting task, but knowledge of the expression of the differential equation can be used to supplement the training objective, leading to the development of physics-informed scientific machine learning. In this article, we focus on one class of models called nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Motivated by connections to numerical integration and physics-informed neural networks, we explicitly derive the physics-informed NVAR (piNVAR) which enforces the right-hand side of the underlying differential equation regardless of NVAR construction. Because NVAR and piNVAR completely share their learned parameters, we propose an augmented procedure to jointly train the two models. Then, using both data-driven and ODE-driven metrics, we evaluate the ability of the piNVAR model to predict solutions to various ODE systems, such as the undamped spring, a Lotka-Volterra predator-prey nonlinear model, and the chaotic Lorenz system.">

        <tr id="Echo state network (ESN) implements an alternative paradigm called reservoir computing to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where internal weights are randomly generated and kept fixed, and only readout weights need to be trained, which greatly reduces the training complexity of RNNs. ESN not only facilitates the practical implementation of RNNs but also shows superior performance over fully trained RNNs across a range of applications. However, the conventional ESN suffers from the drawbacks of stringent conditions for weight convergence and slow convergence speed. This paper proposes a memory regressor extended learning method to update the readout weights of ESNs. By constructing and incorporating a generalized prediction error based on regressor extension and filtering, the capacity of ESN to utilize historical data can be greatly improved. In the discrete-time domain, it is proven that exponential convergence of readout weights is achieved under a condition termed interval excitation that is strictly weaker than the classical condition of persistent excitation. Simulation results on modeling a 10th-order nonlinear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) system have revealed that the proposed approach accelerates weight convergence speed almost ten times higher compared to the conventional ESN.">

Utilizing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), we extract spatial modes from high-fidelity solutions. A dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) method is then applied to vertically stacked matrices of projection coefficients for future prediction of coefficient fields. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is employed to construct a mapping from random parameter inputs to the DMD-predicted coefficient field. These lead to the POD-DMD-PCE method. The innovation lies in vertically stacking projection coefficients, ensuring time-dimensional consistency in the coefficient matrix for DMD and facilitating parameter integration for PCE analysis. This method combines the model reduction of POD with the time extrapolation strengths of DMD, effectively recovering field solutions both within and beyond the training time interval. The efficiency and time extrapolation capabilities of the proposed method are validated through various nonlinear SPDEs. These include a reaction-diffusion equation with 19 parameters, a two-dimensional heat equation with two parameters, and a one-dimensional Burgers equation with three parameters.">

In this paper we leverage the universal approximation properties of neural networks (NNs) to develop neural DeePC algorithms for nonlinear systems. Firstly, we point out that the outputs of the last hidden layer of a deep NN implicitly construct a basis in a so-called neural (feature) space, while the output linear layer performs affine interpolation in the neural space. As such, we can train off-line a deep NN using large data sets of trajectories to learn the neural basis and compute on-line a suitable affine interpolation using DeePC. Secondly, methods for guaranteeing consistency of neural DeePC and for reducing computational complexity are developed. Several neural DeePC formulations are illustrated on a nonlinear pendulum example.">

Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.">

Theoretically, we prove the universal approximation capability of CoNO. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation of CoNO on seven challenging partial differential equations (PDEs), including regular grids, structured meshes, and point clouds. Empirically, CoNO consistently attains state-of-the-art performance, showcasing an average relative gain of 10.9%. Further, CoNO exhibits superior performance, outperforming all other models in additional tasks such as zero-shot super-resolution and robustness to noise. CoNO also exhibits the ability to learn from small amounts of data -- giving the same performance as the next best model with just 60% of the training data. Altogether, CoNO presents a robust and superior model for modeling continuous dynamical systems, providing a fillip to scientific machine learning.">

Existence of a stationary measure is straightforward if $\mathrm{ker}A = \{0\}$, but when the kernel of $A$ is nontrivial a stationary measure can exist only if the nonlinearity transfers enough energy from the undamped modes to the damped modes. We develop a set of sufficient dynamical conditions on $B$ that guarantees the existence of a stationary measure and prove that they hold ``generically'' within our constraint class of nonlinearities provided that $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A)<2d/3$ and the stochastic forcing acts directly on at least two degrees of freedom. We also show that the restriction $\mathrm{dim}(\mathrm{ker}A)<2d/3$ can be removed if one allows the nonlinearity to change by a small amount at discrete times. In particular, for a Markov chain obtained by evolving our SDE on approximately unit random time intervals and slightly perturbing the nonlinearity within our constraint class at each timestep, we prove that there exists a stationary measure whenever just a single mode is damped.">

This representation is then discretized as a manifold of implicit neural representations where the feedforward neural network architecture has a low rank structure. Finally, we show that the low rank neural representation with a fixed number of layers and a small number of coefficients can approximate any entropy solution regardless of the complexity of the shock topology, while retaining the linearity of the embedded dynamics.">

        <tr id="Reservoir computing has been shown to be a useful framework for predicting critical transitions of a dynamical system if the bifurcation parameter is also provided as an input. Its utility is significant because in real-world scenarios, the exact model equations are unknown. This Letter shows how the theory of dynamical system provides the underlying mechanism behind the prediction. Using numerical methods, by considering dynamical systems which show Hopf bifurcation, we demonstrate that the map produced by the reservoir after a successful training undergoes a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation such that the critical point of the map is in immediate proximity to that of the original dynamical system. In addition, we have compared and analyzed different structures in the phase space. Our findings provide insight into the functioning of machine learning algorithms for predicting critical transitions.">

        <tr id="A central aim in computational neuroscience is to relate the activity of large populations of neurons to an underlying dynamical system. Models of these neural dynamics should ideally be both interpretable and fit the observed data well. Low-rank recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit such interpretability by having tractable dynamics. However, it is unclear how to best fit low-rank RNNs to data consisting of noisy observations of an underlying stochastic system. Here, we propose to fit stochastic low-rank RNNs with variational sequential Monte Carlo methods. We validate our method on several datasets consisting of both continuous and spiking neural data, where we obtain lower dimensional latent dynamics than current state of the art methods. Additionally, for low-rank models with piecewise linear nonlinearities, we show how to efficiently identify all fixed points in polynomial rather than exponential cost in the number of units, making analysis of the inferred dynamics tractable for large RNNs. Our method both elucidates the dynamical systems underlying experimental recordings and provides a generative model whose trajectories match observed trial-to-trial variability.">

We demonstrate that, typically, it is enough to take a few first terms of this infinite sum to obtain an excellent approximation to the correlation function at any time, with the large time behavior being determined solely by the first pseudomode. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the framework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method essentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis constructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes, we first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization of the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is facilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the presence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation strength. As an illustration, we apply the pseudomode expansion to calculate infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$ spin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice.">

We introduce a novel weight construction for SSMs, enabling them to predict the next state of any dynamical system after observing previous states without parameter fine-tuning. This is accomplished by extending the HiPPO framework to demonstrate that continuous SSMs can approximate the derivative of any input signal. Specifically, we find an explicit weight construction for continuous SSMs and provide an asymptotic error bound on the derivative approximation. The discretization of this continuous SSM subsequently yields a discrete SSM that predicts the next state. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our parameterization empirically.

Our construction of NGOs is derived directly from the Green's formulation of such a solution operator. Similar to deep operator networks (DeepONets) and variationally mimetic operator networks (VarMiONs), NGOs constitutes an expansion of the solution to the PDE in terms of basis functions, that is returned from a sub-network, contracted with coefficients, that are returned from another sub-network. However, in accordance with the Green's formulation, NGOs accept weighted averages of the input functions, rather than sampled values thereof, as is the case in DeepONets and VarMiONs. Application of NGOs to canonical linear parametric PDEs shows that, while they remain competitive with DeepONets, VarMiONs and Fourier neural operators when testing on data that lie within the training distribution, they robustly generalize when testing on finer-scale data generated outside of the training distribution. Furthermore, we show that the explicit representation of the Green's function that is returned by NGOs enables the construction of effective preconditioners for numerical solvers for PDEs.">

Using a large neuroimaging dataset of over 1,000 people, CHARM captured the critical, non-local/long-range nature of brain dynamics and the underlying mechanisms were established using a precise whole-brain model. Equally, CHARM revealed the significantly different critical dynamics of wakefulness and sleep. Overall, CHARM is a promising theoretical framework for capturing the low-dimensionality of the complex network dynamics observed in neuroscience and provides evidence that networks of brain regions rather than individual brain regions are the key computational engines of critical brain dynamics.">

A number of algorithms have been proposed in recent years to solve such problems; a common feature of all these methods is that they implicitly require precise knowledge of the temporal variability of the solutions in order to exactly track the optimizers. In this paper, we seek to lift these stringent assumptions. Our main result is a fundamental characterization, showing that an algorithm can track an optimal trajectory if and only if it contains a model of the temporal variability of the problem. We refer to this concept to as the internal model principle of time-varying optimization. By recasting the optimization objective as a nonlinear regulation problem and using tools from center manifold theory, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions both for an optimization algorithm to achieve exact asymptotic tracking and for such an algorithm to exist. We illustrate the applicability of the approach numerically on both synthetic problems as well as practical problems in transportation.">

A subset of such dynamical systems that can model chemical reactions under mass-action kinetics are called chemical systems. A central problem in synthetic biology is to map general polynomial dynamical systems into dynamically similar chemical ones. In this paper, we present a novel map, called the quasi-chemical map, that can systematically solve this problem. The quasi-chemical map introduces suitable state-dependent perturbations into any given polynomial dynamical system which then becomes chemical under suitably large translation of variables. We prove that this map preserves robust dynamical features, such as generic equilibria and limit cycles, as well as temporal properties, such as periods of oscillations. Furthermore, the resulting chemical systems are of only at most one degree higher than the original dynamical systems. We demonstrate the quasi-chemical map by designing relatively simple chemical systems with exotic dynamics and pre-defined bifurcation structures.">

Sparse models are capable of maintaining the high accuracy of state of the art models, while functioning at the cost of more parsimonious models. The structures which underlie sparse architectures are, however, poorly understood and not consistent between differently trained models and sparsification schemes. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sparsification of recurrent neural nets (RNNs), called moduli regularization, in combination with magnitude pruning. Moduli regularization leverages the dynamical system induced by the recurrent structure to induce a geometric relationship between neurons in the hidden state of the RNN. By making our regularizing term explicitly geometric, we provide the first, to our knowledge, a priori description of the desired sparse architecture of our neural net. We verify the effectiveness of our scheme for navigation and natural language processing RNNs. Navigation is a structurally geometric task, for which there are known moduli spaces, and we show that regularization can be used to reach 90% sparsity while maintaining model performance only when coefficients are chosen in accordance with a suitable moduli space. Natural language processing, however, has no known moduli space in which computations are performed. Nevertheless, we show that moduli regularization induces more stable recurrent neural nets with a variety of moduli regularizers, and achieves high fidelity models at 98% sparsity.">

However, predicting the behavior of systems with temporal parameter variations without knowledge of true parameter values remains a significant challenge. This study leverages the reservoir computing framework to address this problem by unsupervised extraction of slowly varying system parameters from time series data. We propose a model architecture consisting of a slow reservoir with long timescale internal dynamics and a fast reservoir with short timescale dynamics. The slow reservoir extracts the temporal variation of system parameters, which are then used to predict unknown bifurcations in the fast dynamics. Through experiments using data generated from chaotic dynamical systems, we demonstrate the ability to predict bifurcations not present in the training data. Our approach shows potential for applications in fields such as neuroscience, material science, and weather prediction, where slow dynamics influencing qualitative changes are often unobservable.">

        <tr id="Approximation of solutions to partial differential equations (PDE) is an important problem in computational science and engineering. Using neural networks as an ansatz for the solution has proven a challenge in terms of training time and approximation accuracy. In this contribution, we discuss how sampling the hidden weights and biases of the ansatz network from data-agnostic and data-dependent probability distributions allows us to progress on both challenges. In most examples, the random sampling schemes outperform iterative, gradient-based optimization of physics-informed neural networks regarding training time and accuracy by several orders of magnitude. For time-dependent PDE, we construct neural basis functions only in the spatial domain and then solve the associated ordinary differential equation with classical methods from scientific computing over a long time horizon. This alleviates one of the greatest challenges for neural PDE solvers because it does not require us to parameterize the solution in time. For second-order elliptic PDE in Barron spaces, we prove the existence of sampled networks with $L^2$ convergence to the solution. We demonstrate our approach on several time-dependent and static PDEs. We also illustrate how sampled networks can effectively solve inverse problems in this setting. Benefits compared to common numerical schemes include spectral convergence and mesh-free construction of basis functions.">

        <tr id="This paper examines the alignment of inductive biases in machine learning (ML) with structural models of economic dynamics. Unlike dynamical systems found in physical and life sciences, economics models are often specified by differential equations with a mixture of easy-to-enforce initial conditions and hard-to-enforce infinite horizon boundary conditions (e.g. transversality and no-ponzi-scheme conditions). Traditional methods for enforcing these constraints are computationally expensive and unstable. We investigate algorithms where those infinite horizon constraints are ignored, simply training unregularized kernel machines and neural networks to obey the differential equations. Despite the inherent underspecification of this approach, our findings reveal that the inductive biases of these ML models innately enforce the infinite-horizon conditions necessary for the well-posedness. We theoretically demonstrate that (approximate or exact) min-norm ML solutions to interpolation problems are sufficient conditions for these infinite-horizon boundary conditions in a wide class of problems. We then provide empirical evidence that deep learning and ridgeless kernel methods are not only theoretically sound with respect to economic assumptions, but may even dominate classic algorithms in low to medium dimensions. More importantly, these results give confidence that, despite solving seemingly ill-posed problems, there are reasons to trust the plethora of black-box ML algorithms used by economists to solve previously intractable, high-dimensional dynamical systems -- paving the way for future work on estimation of inverse problems with embedded optimal control problems.">

The Hamiltonian term is treated as an integrating factor by forward and backward Fourier transformations, which are here carried out classically. This split allows us to avoid higher-order time integration schemes, to apply a first-order explicit time stepping for the remaining nonlinear NLSE term in a variational algorithm block, and thus to avoid numerical instabilities. We demonstrate that the analytical solution is reproduced with a small root mean square error for a long time interval over which a nonlinear soliton propagates significantly forward in space while keeping its shape. We analyze the accuracy of the quantum algorithm and compare it with classical approaches. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of algorithm parameters on the accuracy of the results, including the temporal step width and the depth of the quantum circuit.">

        <tr id="Reduced basis methods for approximating the solutions of parameter-dependant partial differential equations (PDEs) are based on learning the structure of the set of solutions - seen as a manifold ${\mathcal S}$ in some functional space - when the parameters vary. This involves investigating the manifold and, in particular, understanding whether it is close to a low-dimensional affine space. This leads to the notion of Kolmogorov $N$-width that consists of evaluating to which extent the best choice of a vectorial space of dimension $N$ approximates ${\mathcal S}$ well enough. If a good approximation of elements in ${\mathcal S}$ can be done with some well-chosen vectorial space of dimension $N$ -- provided $N$ is not too large -- then a ``reduced'' basis can be proposed that leads to a Galerkin type method for the approximation of any element in ${\mathcal S}$. In many cases, however, the Kolmogorov $N$-width is not so small, even if the parameter set lies in a space of small dimension yielding a manifold with small dimension. In terms of complexity reduction, this gap between the small dimension of the manifold and the large Kolmogorov $N$-width can be explained by the fact that the Kolmogorov $N$-width is linear while, in contrast, the dependency in the parameter is, most often, non-linear. There have been many contributions aiming at reconciling these two statements, either based on deterministic or AI approaches. We investigate here further a new paradigm that, in some sense, merges these two aspects: the nonlinear compressive reduced basisapproximation. We focus on a simple multiparameter problem and illustrate rigorously that the complexity associated with the approximation of the solution to the parameter dependant PDE is directly related to the number of parameters rather than the Kolmogorov $N$-width.">

Many complex systems for which data-driven modeling and control are sought provide streaming sensor data, the abundance of which can present computational challenges but cannot be ignored. Streaming data can intermittently sample dynamically different regimes or rare events which could be critical to model and control. Using ideas from subspace identification, we present a method where the Grassmannian distance between the subspace of an extended observability matrix and the streaming segment of data is used to assess the `novelty' of the data. If this distance is above a threshold, it is added to an archive and the Koopman operator is updated if not it is discarded. Therefore, our method identifies data from segments of trajectories of a dynamical system that are from different dynamical regimes, prioritizes minimizing the amount of data needed in updating the Koopman model and furthermore reduces the number of basis functions by learning them adaptively. Therefore, by dynamically adjusting the amount of data used and learning basis functions, our method optimizes the model's accuracy and the system order.">

        <tr id="In the context of model-based control of industrial processes, it is a common practice to develop a data-driven linear dynamical model around a specified operating point. However, in applications involving wider operating conditions, representation of the dynamics using a single linear dynamic model is often inadequate, requiring either a nonlinear model or multiple linear models to accommodate the nonlinear behaviour. While the development of the former suffers from the requirements of extensive experiments spanning multiple levels, significant compromise in the nominal product quality and dealing with unmeasured disturbances over wider operating conditions, the latter faces the challenge of model switch scheduling and inadequate description of dynamics for the operating regions in-between. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient approach to obtain a parsimonious nonlinear dynamic model by developing multiple linear models from data at multiple operating points, lifting the data features obtained from individual model simulations to adequately accommodate the underlying nonlinear behaviour and finally, sparse optimization techniques to obtain a parsimonious model. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation case studies.">

        <tr id="In a landscape where scientific discovery is increasingly driven by data, the integration of machine learning (ML) with traditional scientific methodologies has emerged as a transformative approach. This paper introduces a novel, data-driven framework that synergizes physics-based priors with advanced ML techniques to address the computational and practical limitations inherent in first-principle-based methods and brute-force machine learning methods. Our framework showcases four algorithms, each embedding a specific physics-based prior tailored to a particular class of nonlinear systems, including separable and nonseparable Hamiltonian systems, hyperbolic partial differential equations, and incompressible fluid dynamics. The intrinsic incorporation of physical laws preserves the system's intrinsic symmetries and conservation laws, ensuring solutions are physically plausible and computationally efficient. The integration of these priors also enhances the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to capture complex patterns typical in physical phenomena that conventional methods often miss. As a result, our models outperform existing data-driven techniques in terms of prediction accuracy, robustness, and predictive capability, particularly in recognizing features absent from the training set, despite relying on small datasets, short training periods, and small sample sizes.">

The Lagrangian formulation alone is insufficient to fully capture the holistic behavior of the system. Coupling and dissipation mechanisms play a pivotal role in shaping the system's response. Consequently, to effectively capture the dynamics of inter-coupled electro-mechanical systems with dissipation, we propose an extended Lagrangian-informed deep neural network framework in this paper. Our approach leverages the underlying physics-based knowledge of the system, incorporating it into the neural network architecture. By employing the Euler-Lagrange equations as constraints in the training process, we ensure that the learned dynamics conform to the true behavior of the system. To validate the theoretical framework, we conduct simulation experiments on a DC motor with a cart system, which serves as a representative model of dissipative nonlinear electro-mechanical systems. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in accurately capturing and integrating the dynamics to solve the reference tracking model predictive control design.">

We provide a rigorous convergence statement of the method. The proof circumvents challenges posed by the ambiguity of discrete Lagrangian densities in the inverse problem of variational calculus. Moreover, our method can be used to quantify model uncertainty in the equations of motions and any linear observable of the discrete field theory. This is illustrated on the example of the discrete wave equation and Schr\"odinger equation.

Trained ML models can make predictions much faster than computationally expensive physics simulations. In this work, we have proposed a temporally structured variational autoencoder model to autoregressively forecast the spatiotemporal dynamics of the 15 unique 2D projections of 6D phase space of charged particle beam as it travels through the LANSCE linear accelerator. In the model, VAE embeds the phase space projections into a lower dimensional latent space. A long-short-term memory network then learns the temporal correlations in the latent space. The trained network can evolve the phase space projections across further modules provided the first few modules as inputs. The model predicts all the projections across different modules with low mean squared error and high structural similarity index.">

Analyzed are SINDy’s abilities to accurately represent transient/steady-state behaviour, noise effect, and model structure. A sparse set of basis functions can effectively capture the dynamics of a system, according to the data-driven approach known as SINDy. The coefficients of these basis functions are determined via methods of sparse regression, and the final model is made up of a number of sparse ordinary differential equations. The findings demonstrate that SINDy, with sufficient time-series data, can capture both transient and steady-state phenomena. According to the analysis of the noise effect, SINDy’s performance declines as the system’s noise level rises. The feature library must contain the appropriate model structure in order for SINDy to function effectively. SINDy has the potential to extract unknown system dynamics from experimental data.">

        <tr id="This work proposes a data‐driven state observation algorithm for nonlinear dynamical systems, when the true state trajectory is not measurable and hence the states information needs to be reconstructed from input and output measurements. Such a reduction is formed by kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA), which (i) implicitly maps the available input–output data into a higher‐dimensional feature space, namely the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS); (ii) finds a projection of the past input–output data and a projection of the future input–output data with maximal correlation; and (iii) identifies the projected inputs and outputs, namely the canonical variates, as the observed states. We adopt a least squares support vector machine (LS‐SVM) formulation for KCCA, which imposes regularization on the vectors that specify the projections and is amenable to convex optimization. We prove theoretically that, based on the statistical consistency of KCCA, the observed states determined by the proposed state observer has a guaranteed correlativity with the actual states (when properly transformed). Furthermore, such observed states, when supplemented with the information of succeeding inputs, can be used to predict the succeeding outputs with guaranteed upper bound on the prediction error.

        <tr id="Using equilibrium fluctuations to understand the response of a physical system to an externally imposed perturbation is the basis for linear response theory, which is widely used to interpret experiments and shed light on microscopic dynamics. For nonequilibrium systems, perturbations cannot be interpreted simply by monitoring fluctuations in a conjugate observable -- additional dynamical information is needed. The theory of linear response around nonequilibrium steady states relies on path ensemble averaging, which makes this theory inapplicable to perturbations that affect the diffusion constant or temperature in a stochastic system. Here, we show that a separate, ``effective'' physical process can be used to describe the perturbed dynamics and that this dynamics in turn allows us to accurately calculate the response to a change in the diffusion. Interestingly, the effective dynamics contains an additional drift that is proportional to the ``score'' of the instantaneous probability density of the system -- this object has also been studied extensively in recent years in the context of denoising diffusion models in the machine learning literature. Exploiting recently developed algorithms for learning the score, we show that we can carry out nonequilibrium response calculations on systems for which the exact score cannot be obtained.">

We take a machine learning approach and propose using graph neural networks as a general-purpose preconditioner. They show attractive performance for ill-conditioned problems, in part because they better approximate the matrix inverse from appropriately generated training data. Empirical evaluation on over 800 matrices suggests that the construction time of these graph neural preconditioners (GNPs) is more predictable than other widely used ones, such as ILU and AMG, while the execution time is faster than using a Krylov method as the preconditioner, such as in inner-outer GMRES. GNPs have a strong potential for solving large-scale, challenging algebraic problems arising from not only partial differential equations, but also economics, statistics, graph, and optimization, to name a few.">

We propose a targeted learning strategy which facilitates robust unsupervised learning in an offline phase and provides a highly efficient initialisation for the Newton iteration leading to consistent acceleration of Newton's method. A quantifiable rate of improvement in Newton's method achieved by improved initialisation is provided and we analyse the upper bound of the generalisation error of our unsupervised learning strategy.

        <tr id="In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks, have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that geometric pruning, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights with a low contribution to an attractor's geometrical structure are removed, indeed manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights, is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like small-world or scale-free networks.">

        <tr id="We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.">

        <tr id="The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures. Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities for future development in this field.">

        <tr id="Neural simulators for modeling complex dynamical systems have been extensively studied for various real-world applications, such as weather forecasting, ocean current prediction, and computational fluid dynamics simulation. Although they have demonstrated powerful fitting and predicting, most existing models are only built to learn single-system dynamics. Several advanced researches have considered learning dynamics across environments, which can exploit the potential commonalities among the dynamics across environments and adapt to new environments. However, these methods still are prone to scarcity problems where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Therefore, we propose a novel CoNDP (Context-Informed Neural ODE Processes) to achieve learning system dynamics from sparse observations across environments. It can fully use contextual information of each environment to better capture the intrinsic commonalities across environments and distinguishable differences among environments while modeling uncertainty of system evolution, producing more accurate predictions. Intensive experiments are conducted on five complex dynamical systems in various fields. Results show that the proposed CoNDP can achieve optimal results compared with common neural simulators and state-of-the-art cross-environmental models.">

        <tr id="Laplace approximations are popular techniques for endowing deep networks with epistemic uncertainty estimates as they can be applied without altering the predictions of the neural network, and they scale to large models and datasets. While the choice of prior strongly affects the resulting posterior distribution, computational tractability and lack of interpretability of weight space typically limit the Laplace approximation to isotropic Gaussian priors, which are known to cause pathological behavior as depth increases. As a remedy, we directly place a prior on function space. More precisely, since Lebesgue densities do not exist on infinite-dimensional function spaces, we have to recast training as finding the so-called weak mode of the posterior measure under a Gaussian process (GP) prior restricted to the space of functions representable by the neural network. Through the GP prior, one can express structured and interpretable inductive biases, such as regularity or periodicity, directly in function space, while still exploiting the implicit inductive biases that allow deep networks to generalize. After model linearization, the training objective induces a negative log-posterior density to which we apply a Laplace approximation, leveraging highly scalable methods from matrix-free linear algebra. Our method provides improved results where prior knowledge is abundant, e.g., in many scientific inference tasks. At the same time, it stays competitive for black-box regression and classification tasks where neural networks typically excel.">

We propose to use"low-rank plus diagonal"PSD matrices as approximations that can be stored with a memory cost being linear in the high dimension d. To constrain the solution of the differential equation to remain in that subset, we project the derivative at all times onto the tangent space to the subset, following the methodology of dynamical low-rank approximation. We derive a closed-form formula for the projection, and show that after some manipulations it can be computed with a numerical cost being linear in d, allowing for tractable implementation. Contrary to previous approaches based on pure low-rank approximations, the addition of the diagonal term allows for our approximations to be invertible matrices, that can moreover be inverted with linear cost in d. We apply the technique to Riccati-like equations, then to two particular problems. Firstly a low-rank approximation to our recent Wasserstein gradient flow for Gaussian approximation of posterior distributions in approximate Bayesian inference, and secondly a novel low-rank approximation of the Kalman filter for high-dimensional systems. Numerical simulations illustrate the results.">

First, high-dimensional training data samples will be mapped to a low-dimensional feature space through the principal component analysis (PCA) featuring process. Following that, the feature space is bisected into multiple partitions based on the variation of the Shannon entropy under the maximum entropy (ME) bisecting process. The behavior of subsystems in the prespecified state space partitions will then be approximated using a group of shallow neural networks (SNNs) known as extreme learning machines (ELMs), and then it can further simplify the model by merging the redundant lattices based on their training error performance. The proposed modeling framework can handle high-dimensional dynamical system modeling problems with the advantages of reducing model complexity and improving model performance in training and verification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling framework, examples of modeling the LASA dataset and an industrial robot are presented.">

Yet, data-driven DLO dynamics models require large training data sets while their predictions often do not generalize, whereas physics-based models rely on good approximations of physical phenomena and often lack accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed neural ODE capable of predicting agile movements with significantly less data and hyper-parameter tuning. In particular, we model DLOs as serial chains of rigid bodies interconnected by passive elastic joints in which interaction forces are predicted by neural networks. The proposed model accurately predicts the motion of an robotically-actuated aluminium rod and an elastic foam cylinder after being trained on only thirty seconds of data.

 We present a tensor-based method for model selection which identifies the unknown partial differential equation that governs a dynamical system using only spatiotemporal measurements. The method circumvents a disadvantage of standard matrix-based methods which typically have large storage consumption. Using a recently developed multidimensional approximation of nonlinear dynamical systems, we collect the nonlinear and partial derivative terms of the measured data and construct a low-rank dictionary tensor in the tensor-train format. A tensor-based linear regression problem is then built, which balances the learning accuracy, model complexity, and computational efficiency. An algebraic expression of the unknown equations can be extracted. Numerical results are demonstrated on datasets generated by the wave equation, the Burgers' equation, and a few parametric partial differential equations.">

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.">

        <tr id="Networks in machine learning offer examples of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems inspired by and reminiscent of biological systems. Here, we study the learning dynamics of generalized Hopfield networks, which permit visualization of internal memories. These networks have been shown to proceed through a “feature-to-prototype” transition, as the strength of network nonlinearity is increased, wherein the learned, or terminal, states of internal memories transition from mixed to pure states. Focusing on the prototype learning dynamics of the internal memories, we observe stereotypical dynamics of memories wherein similar subgroups of memories sequentially split at well-defined saddles. The splitting order is interpretable and reproducible from one simulation to the other. The dynamics prior to splits are robust to variations in many features of the system. To develop a more rigorous understanding of these global dynamics, we study smaller subsystems that exhibit similar properties to the full system. Within these smaller systems, we combine analytical calculations with numerical simulations to study the dynamics of the feature-to-prototype transition, and the emergence of saddle points in the learning landscape. We exhibit regimes where saddles appear and disappear through saddle-node bifurcations, qualitatively changing the distribution of learned memories as the strength of the nonlinearity is varied—allowing us to systematically investigate the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of the learning dynamics. Several features of the learning dynamics are reminiscent of the Waddington's caricature of cellular differentiation, and we attempt to make this analogy more precise. Memories can thus differentiate in a predictive and controlled way, revealing bridges between experimental biology, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning.

This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).">

So far, this approach has been applied mainly under the assumption that all components of the state vector of dynamical systems are observable. Here we study the effectiveness of this method when only a scalar time series is available for observation. As illustrations, we use the time series of Rössler and Lorenz systems, as well as the chaotic time series generated by an electronic circuit. We found that prediction is only effective if the feature vector of a nonlinear autoregression algorithm contains monomials of a sufficiently high degree. Moreover, the prediction can be improved by replacing monomials with Chebyshev polynomials. Next-generation models, built on the basis of partial observations, are suitable not only for short-term forecasting, but are also capable of reproducing the long-term climate of chaotic systems. We demonstrate the reconstruction of the bifurcation diagram of the Rössler system and the return maps of the Lorenz and electronic circuit systems.">

        <tr id="We study interacting particle systems driven by noise, modeling phenomena such as opinion dynamics. We are interested in systems that exhibit phase transitions i.e. non-uniqueness of stationary states for the corresponding McKean-Vlasov PDE, in the mean field limit. We develop an efficient numerical scheme for identifying all steady states (both stable and unstable) of the mean field McKean-Vlasov PDE, based on a spectral Galerkin approximation combined with a deflated Newton's method to handle the multiplicity of solutions. Having found all possible equilibra, we formulate an optimal control strategy for steering the dynamics towards a chosen unstable steady state. The control is computed using iterated open-loop solvers in a receding horizon fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed steady state computation and stabilization methodology on several examples, including the noisy Hegselmann-Krause model for opinion dynamics and the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model from biophysics. The numerical experiments validate the ability of the approach to capture the rich self-organization landscape of these systems and to stabilize unstable configurations of interest. The proposed computational framework opens up new possibilities for understanding and controlling the collective behavior of noise-driven interacting particle systems, with potential applications in various fields such as social dynamics, biological synchronization, and collective behavior in physical and social systems.">

        <tr id="Spectral methods provide highly accurate numerical solutions for partial differential equations, exhibiting exponential convergence with the number of spectral nodes. Traditionally, in addressing time-dependent nonlinear problems, attention has been on low-order finite difference schemes for time discretization and spectral element schemes for spatial variables. However, our recent developments have resulted in the application of spectral methods to both space and time variables, preserving spectral convergence in both domains. Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the"Step Truncation TT-Newton"method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples. Importantly, our scheme offers significantly reduced memory requirement compared to the full-grid scheme.">

        <tr id="Transformer models are increasingly used for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Several adaptations have been proposed, all of which suffer from the typical problems of Transformers, such as quadratic memory and time complexity. Furthermore, all prevalent architectures for PDE solving lack at least one of several desirable properties of an ideal surrogate model, such as (i) generalization to PDE parameters not seen during training, (ii) spatial and temporal zero-shot super-resolution, (iii) continuous temporal extrapolation, (iv) support for 1D, 2D, and 3D PDEs, and (v) efficient inference for longer temporal rollouts. To address these limitations, we propose Vectorized Conditional Neural Fields (VCNeFs), which represent the solution of time-dependent PDEs as neural fields. Contrary to prior methods, however, VCNeFs compute, for a set of multiple spatio-temporal query points, their solutions in parallel and model their dependencies through attention mechanisms. Moreover, VCNeF can condition the neural field on both the initial conditions and the parameters of the PDEs. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates that VCNeFs are competitive with and often outperform existing ML-based surrogate models.">

        <tr id="Bifurcations mark qualitative changes of long-term behavior in dynamical systems and can often signal sudden ("hard") transitions or catastrophic events (divergences). Accurately locating them is critical not just for deeper understanding of observed dynamic behavior, but also for designing efficient interventions. When the dynamical system at hand is complex, possibly noisy, and expensive to sample, standard (e.g. continuation based) numerical methods may become impractical. We propose an active learning framework, where Bayesian Optimization is leveraged to discover saddle-node or Hopf bifurcations, from a judiciously chosen small number of vector field observations. Such an approach becomes especially attractive in systems whose state x parameter space exploration is resource-limited. It also naturally provides a framework for uncertainty quantification (aleatoric and epistemic), useful in systems with inherent stochasticity.">

The peculiar properties of discrete Walsh functions are directly utilized to compute the Walsh coefficients of the systems, and the projection matrix is defined properly to generate reduced models by taking into account the non-zero initial conditions. It is shown that reduced models can preserve some Walsh coefficients of the expansion of the original systems. Further, the superposition principle is exploited to achieve a decomposition of the original systems, and a new definition of Gramians is proposed by combining the individual Gramians of each subsystem. As a result, the balanced truncation method is applied to systems with inhomogeneous initial conditions.

Even though we have a general understanding of the fundamental components in the transformer architecture, little is known about how they operate or what are their expected dynamics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the relationship between attention mechanisms and Hopfield networks, promising to shed light on the statistical physics of transformer networks. However, to date, the dynamical regimes of transformer-like models have not been studied in depth. In this paper, we address this gap by using methods for the study of asymmetric Hopfield networks in nonequilibrium regimes --namely path integral methods over generating functionals, yielding dynamics governed by concurrent mean-field variables. Assuming 1-bit tokens and weights, we derive analytical approximations for the behavior of large self-attention neural networks coupled to a softmax output, which become exact in the large limit size. Our findings reveal nontrivial dynamical phenomena, including nonequilibrium phase transitions associated with chaotic bifurcations, even for very simple configurations with a few encoded features and a very short context window. Finally, we discuss the potential of our analytic approach to improve our understanding of the inner workings of transformer models, potentially reducing computational training costs and enhancing model interpretability.">

We will show the application of a stochastic coupling filter that can approximate arbitrary transition densities under non-Gaussian noise. The filter is based on transport maps, which couple the approximation densities to a user-chosen reference density, allowing for straightforward sampling and evaluation of probabilities.">

That progress prompts our consideration of how one could use such a high dimensional function to extract mechanistic insight. Here, we present and illustrate a straightforward but powerful way to track how individual dynamical coordinates evolve during a reactive event. The strategy, which involves marginalizing the reactive ensemble, naturally captures the evolution of the dynamical coordinate's distribution, not just its mean reactive behavior.">

This principle employs covariance and standard deviation of particle states to measure prediction accuracy. In this study, we bring these two approaches together to analyze the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm in two-player zero-sum games.

Upon perturbation, this invariance is destroyed, allowing trajectories to randomly switch between subintervals. We show that the invariant density of the randomly perturbed system may be approximated by an explicit convex combination of the two initially invariant densities, obtained by averaging. Further, we also identify the limit of the second Oseledets space, or coherent structure, as the perturbation shrinks to zero.

        <tr id="We developed a novel reservoir characterization workflow that addresses reservoir history matching by coupling a physics-informed neural operator (PINO) forward model with a mixture of experts' approach, termed cluster classify regress (CCR). The inverse modelling is achieved via an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman inversion (aREKI) method, ideal for rapid inverse uncertainty quantification during history matching. We parametrize unknown permeability and porosity fields for non-Gaussian posterior measures using a variational convolution autoencoder and a denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) exotic priors. The CCR works as a supervised model with the PINO surrogate to replicate nonlinear Peaceman well equations. The CCR's flexibility allows any independent machine-learning algorithm for each stage. The PINO reservoir surrogate's loss function is derived from supervised data loss and losses from the initial conditions and residual of the governing black oil PDE. The PINO-CCR surrogate outputs pressure, water, and gas saturations, along with oil, water, and gas production rates. The methodology was compared to a standard numerical black oil simulator for a waterflooding case on the Norne field, showing similar outputs. This PINO-CCR surrogate was then used in the aREKI history matching workflow, successfully recovering the unknown permeability, porosity and fault multiplier, with simulations up to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. Training the PINO-CCR surrogate on an NVIDIA H100 with 80G memory takes about 5 hours for 100 samples of the Norne field. This workflow is suitable for ensemble-based approaches, where posterior density sampling, given an expensive likelihood evaluation, is desirable for uncertainty quantification.">

The linear operator is also assumed to be a general operator with sinusoidal eigenvectors. Moreover, we assume that there is a first transition as a real simple eigenvalue changes sign. With this general framework, we make a rigorous analysis of the dependence of the first transition dynamics on the coefficients of the Taylor expansion of the nonlinear operator. The main tool we use in this study is the center manifold reduction combined with the classification of the dynamic transition theory. This study is a generalization of a recent work where the nonlinear operator contains only low‐order (quadratic and cubic) nonlinearities. The current generalization requires certain technical difficulties such as the validity of the genericity conditions on the Taylor coefficients of the nonlinear operator and a bootstrapping argument using these genericity conditions. The results of this work can be generalized in various directions, which are discussed in the conclusions section.">

Elements of the PECCARY method have been used in a variety of physical, biological, economic, and mathematical scenarios, but have not yet gained traction in the astrophysical community. This study introduces the PECCARY technique with the specific aims to motivate its use in and optimize it for the analysis of astrophysical orbital systems. PECCARY works by decomposing a time-dependent measure, such as the x-coordinate or orbital angular momentum time-series, into ordinal patterns. Due to its unique approach and statistical nature, PECCARY is well-suited for detecting preferred and forbidden patterns (a signature of chaos), even when the chaotic behavior is short-lived or when working with a relatively short duration time-series or small sets of time-series data. A variety of examples are used to demonstrate the capabilities of PECCARY. These include mathematical examples (sine waves, varieties of noise, sums of sine waves, well-known chaotic functions), a double pendulum system, and astrophysical tracer particle simulations with potentials of varying intricacies. Since the adopted timescale used to diagnose a given time-series can affect the outcome, a method is presented to identify an ideal sampling scheme, constrained by the overall duration and the natural timescale of the system. The accompanying PECCARY Python package and its usage are discussed.">

This expansion presents a challenge, as infinite-dimensional spaces typically lack closed-form densities. Leveraging our theory, we establish that solving the optimal control problem with a specific objective function choice is equivalent to learning diffusion-based generative models. We propose two applications: (1) learning bridges between two infinite-dimensional distributions and (2) generative models for sampling from an infinite-dimensional distribution. Our approach proves effective for diverse problems involving continuous function space representations, such as resolution-free images, time-series data, and probability density functions.">

        <tr id="Modeling dynamical systems is a fundamental task in scientific and engineering fields, often accomplished by applying theory-based models with mathematical equations. Yet, in cases where these equations cannot be established or parameterized properly, theory-based models are not applicable. Instead, a viable alternative is to learn the system dynamics directly from data, for example with deep learning models. However, traditional deep learning models often produce physically inconsistent results and struggle to generalize to unseen data, especially when training data is limited. One solution to this shortcoming is knowledge-guided deep learning, leveraging prior knowledge about the expected behavior of a dynamical system. In this work, we identify and formalize permissible system states, a novel type of prior knowledge that is often available for systems in the context of temporal dynamics modeling. This prior knowledge describes dynamic states that the system is allowed to take during its operation. We propose a knowledge-guided multi-state constraint to encode this type of prior knowledge through a loss function, making it applicable to any deep learning model. This approach allows to create an accurate data-driven model with minimal effort and data requirements. We validate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to model the temporal behavior of a gas turbine in response to an input control signal. Our results indicate that the proposed method reduces the prediction error by up to 40%. In addition to reducing the dependency on extensive training data, our method mitigates training randomness and enhances the consistency of predictions with the expected behavior.">

We introduce a new method to learn low-dimensional representations of nonlinear time series without supervision and can have provable recovery guarantees. The learned representation can be used for downstream machine-learning tasks such as clustering and classification. The method is based on the assumption that the observed sequences arise from a common domain, but each sequence obeys its own autoregressive models that are related to each other through low-rank regularization. We cast the problem as a computationally efficient convex matrix parameter recovery problem using monotone Variational Inequality and encode the common domain assumption via low-rank constraint across the learned representations, which can learn the geometry for the entire domain as well as faithful representations for the dynamics of each individual sequence using the domain information in totality. We show the competitive performance of our method on real-world time-series data with the baselines and demonstrate its effectiveness for symbolic text modeling and RNA sequence clustering.">

Large scale optimization is performed using a second-order variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, where the gradient and Hessian are computed via automatic differentiation. Illustrations involving canonical systems of ordinary and partial differential equations are used to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of the approach.

        <tr id="The effective inclusion of a priori knowledge when embedding known data in physics‐based models of dynamical systems can ensure that the reconstructed model respects physical principles, while simultaneously improving the accuracy of the solution in the previously unseen regions of state space. This paper presents a physics‐constrained data‐driven discrepancy modeling method that variationally embeds known data in the modeling framework. The hierarchical structure of the method yields fine scale variational equations that facilitate the derivation of residuals which are comprised of the first‐principles theory and sensor‐based data from the dynamical system. The embedding of the sensor data via residual terms leads to discrepancy‐informed closure models that yield a method which is driven not only by boundary and initial conditions, but also by measurements that are taken at only a few observation points in the target system. Specifically, the data‐embedding term serves as residual‐based least‐squares loss function, thus retaining variational consistency. Another important relation arises from the interpretation of the stabilization tensor as a kernel function, thereby incorporating a priori knowledge of the problem and adding computational intelligence to the modeling framework. Numerical test cases show that when known data is taken into account, the data driven variational (DDV) method can correctly predict the system response in the presence of several types of discrepancies. Specifically, the damped solution and correct energy time histories are recovered by including known data in the undamped situation. Morlet wavelet analyses reveal that the surrogate problem with embedded data recovers the fundamental frequency band of the target system. The enhanced stability and accuracy of the DDV method is manifested via reconstructed displacement and velocity fields that yield time histories of strain and kinetic energies which match the target systems. The proposed DDV method also serves as a procedure for restoring eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a deficient dynamical system when known data is taken into account, as shown in the numerical test cases presented here.">

An increasingly common method to verify complex logic specifications for dynamical systems involves symbolic abstractions: simpler, finite-state models whose behaviour mimics the one of the systems of interest. By sampling trajectories of the concrete, unknown system and via robust analysis, we build a data-driven abstraction, related to the underlying model through a probabilistic behavioural inclusion relation. As the distribution from which the trajectories are drawn is unknown, we adopt two distinct distribution-free theories, namely scenario optimization and conformal prediction. We compare and discuss the differences between the two approaches in terms of the type of guarantees that they are able to provide. Furthermore, via experimental benchmarks we outline the efficiency of the two methods with respect to the number of samples available and the tightness of the guarantees.">

Though CS-LIMs lead to a breakthrough in climate sciences, their mathematical background and properties are worth further exploration. This study focuses on the mathematical perspective of CS-LIMs and introduces two variants: e-CS-LIM and l-CS-LIM. The former refines the original CS-LIM using the interval-wise linear Markov approximation, while the latter serves as an analytic inverse model for the linear periodic stochastic systems. Although relying on approximation, e-CS-LIM converges to l-CS-LIM under specific conditions and shows noise-robust performance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that each CS-LIM reveals the temporal structure of the system. The e-CS-LIM optimizes the original model for better dynamics performance, while l-CS-LIM excels in diffusion estimation due to reduced approximation reliance. Moreover, CS-LIMs are applied to real-world ENSO data, yielding a consistent result aligning with observations and current ENSO understanding.">

        <tr id="Analyzing dynamical data often requires information of the temporal labels, but such information is unavailable in many applications. Recovery of these temporal labels, closely related to the seriation or sequencing problem, becomes crucial in the study. However, challenges arise due to the nonlinear nature of the data and the complexity of the underlying dynamical system, which may be periodic or non-periodic. Additionally, noise within the feature space complicates the theoretical analysis. Our work develops spectral algorithms that leverage manifold learning concepts to recover temporal labels from noisy data. We first construct the graph Laplacian of the data, and then employ the second (and the third) Fiedler vectors to recover temporal labels. This method can be applied to both periodic and aperiodic cases. It also does not require monotone properties on the similarity matrix, which are commonly assumed in existing spectral seriation algorithms. We develop the $\ell_{\infty}$ error of our estimators for the temporal labels and ranking, without assumptions on the eigen-gap. In numerical analysis, our method outperforms spectral seriation algorithms based on a similarity matrix. The performance of our algorithms is further demonstrated on a synthetic biomolecule data example.">

        <tr id="In this work, we propose a set of physics-informed geometric operators (GOs) to enrich the geometric data provided for training surrogate/discriminative models, dimension reduction, and generative models, typically employed for performance prediction, dimension reduction, and creating data-driven parameterisations, respectively. However, as both the input and output streams of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore, the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.">

We show that its approximation error of the solution can be effectively controlled by the training loss for dynamic simulations with long time horizons. The HLConcPINN method in principle allows an arbitrary number of hidden layers not smaller than two and any of the commonly-used smooth activation functions for the hidden layers beyond the first two, with theoretical guarantees. This generalizes several recent neural-network techniques, which have theoretical guarantees but are confined to two hidden layers in the network architecture and the $\tanh$ activation function. Our theoretical analyses subsequently inform the formulation of appropriate training loss functions for these PDEs, leading to physics informed neural network (PINN) type computational algorithms that differ from the standard PINN formulation.

The development of geometry informed deep learning models capable of learning a solution operator for different computational domains is a problem of general importance for a variety of engineering applications. To this end, we propose a physics-informed deep operator network (DeepONet) capable of predicting the scattered pressure field for arbitrarily shaped scatterers using a geometric parameterization approach based on non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS). This approach also results in parsimonious representations of non-trivial scatterer geometries. In contrast to existing physics-based approaches that require model re-evaluation when changing the computational domains, our trained model is capable of learning solution operator that can approximate physically-consistent scattered pressure field in just a few seconds for arbitrary rigid scatterer shapes; it follows that the computational time for forward simulations can improve (i.e. be reduced) by orders of magnitude in comparison to the traditional forward solvers. In addition, this approach can evaluate the scattered pressure field without the need for labeled training data. After presenting the theoretical approach, a comprehensive numerical study is also provided to illustrate the remarkable ability of this approach to simulate the acoustic pressure fields resulting from arbitrary combinations of arbitrary scatterer geometries.

Meanwhile, in the late 1980s, Jan C. Willems proposed an approach that broadened the range of systems studied, now referred to as the behavioral approach. This approach views the behavior of a system as its fundamental element, including all signals that adhere to the system laws (also called system trajectories).

With given correspondence between the spaces, SyncOT minimizes the aggregated cost of the dynamics induced across all considered spaces. The problem is discretized into a finite-dimensional convex problem using a staggered grid. Primal-dual algorithm-based approaches are then developed to solve the discretized problem.

Therefore, time-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank approximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank algorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The dimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically dividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross partitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two numerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional reaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory consumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy compared to a Monte Carlo method.">

        <tr id="Accurately describing properties of challenging problems in physical sciences often requires complex mathematical models that are unmanageable to tackle head-on. Therefore, developing reduced dimensionality representations that encapsulate complex correlation effects in many-body systems is crucial to advance the understanding of these complicated problems. However, a numerical evaluation of these predictive models can still be associated with a significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss a combined framework that integrates recent advances in the development of active-space representations of coupled cluster (CC) downfolded Hamiltonians with neural network approaches. The primary objective of this effort is to train neural networks to eliminate the computationally expensive steps required for evaluating hundreds or thousands of Hugenholtz diagrams, which correspond to multidimensional tensor contractions necessary for evaluating a many-body form of downfolded/effective Hamiltonians. Using small molecular systems (the H2O and HF molecules) as examples, we demonstrate that training neural networks employing effective Hamiltonians for a few nuclear geometries of molecules can accurately interpolate/ extrapolate their forms to other geometrical configurations characterized by different intensities of correlation effects. We also discuss differences between effective interactions that define CC downfolded Hamiltonians with those of bare Hamiltonians defined by Coulomb interactions in the active spaces.">

Existing work considers time-varying games or time-varying optimization problems. For strongly convex optimization problems or strongly monotone games, these results provide tracking guarantees under the assumption that the variation of the time-varying problem is restrained, that is, problems with a sublinear solution path. In this work we extend existing results in two ways: In our first result, we provide tracking bounds for (1) variational inequalities with a sublinear solution path but not necessarily monotone functions, and (2) for periodic time-varying variational inequalities that do not necessarily have a sublinear solution path-length. Our second main contribution is an extensive study of the convergence behavior and trajectory of discrete dynamical systems of periodic time-varying VI. We show that these systems can exhibit provably chaotic behavior or can converge to the solution. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results with experiments.">

        <tr id="Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms typically require large amount of data for training. This means that for nonlinear aeroelastic applications, where small training budgets are driven by the high computational burden associated with generating data, usability of such methods has been limited to highly simplified aeroelastic systems. This paper presents a novel approach for the identification of optimized sparse higher-order polynomial-based aeroelastic reduced order models (ROM) to significantly reduce the amount of training data needed without sacrificing fidelity. Several sparsity promoting algorithms are considered, including; rigid sparsity, LASSO regression, and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The study demonstrates that through OMP, it is possible to efficiently identify optimized s-sparse nonlinear aerodynamic ROMs using only aerodynamic response information. This approach is exemplified in a three-dimensional aeroelastic stabilator model experiencing high amplitude freeplay-induced limit cycles. The comparison shows excellent agreement between the ROM and the full-order aeroelastic response, including the ability to generalize to new freeplay and velocity index values, with online computational savings of several orders of magnitude. The development of an Optimally Sparse ROM (OS-ROM) extends previous higher-order polynomial-based ROM approaches for feasible application to complex three-dimensional nonlinear aeroelastic problems, without incurring significant computational burdens or loss of accuracy.">

To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.">

Classic solvers for this task continue to play a central role, e.g. to generate training data for deep learning analogues. Any such numerical solution is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, both from limited computational resources and limited data (including unknown parameters). Gaussian process analogues to classic PDE simulation methods have recently emerged as a framework to construct fully probabilistic estimates of all these types of uncertainty. So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable. Here we propose a framework combining a discretization scheme based on the popular Finite Volume Method with complementary numerical linear algebra techniques. Practical experiments, including a spatiotemporal tsunami simulation, demonstrate substantially improved scaling behavior of this approach over previous collocation-based techniques.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible. While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii). The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.">

As a result, even nonstochastic gradient descent does not accurately model the underlying dynamical system defined by the gradient flow of the training loss. We use an exponential Euler solver to train the network without entering the edge of stability, so that we accurately approximate the true gradient descent dynamics. We demonstrate experimentally that the increase in the sharpness of the Hessian matrix is caused by the layerwise Jacobian matrices of the network becoming aligned, so that a small change in the network preactivations near the inputs of the network can cause a large change in the outputs of the network. We further demonstrate that the degree of alignment scales with the size of the dataset by a power law with a coefficient of determination between 0.74 and 0.98.">

This paper introduces a state observer-based approach for the state estimation of such networks, focusing specifically on a class of complex dynamic networks with nodes that correspond one-to-one. Initially, a chaotic system is employed to model the dynamics of each node and highlight the essential state components for analysis and derivation. A network state observer is then constructed using a unique diagonal matrix, which underpins the driver and response-layer networks. By integrating control theory and stability function analysis, the effectiveness of the observer in achieving synchronization between complex dynamic networks and target systems is confirmed. Additionally, the efficacy and precision of the proposed method are validated through simulation.">

When the instance dynamics are known but otherwise arbitrary, we obtain oracle-efficient $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret by reduction to online convex optimization, which can be made computationally efficient if dynamics are locally \textit{action-linear}. In the presence of adversarial disturbances to the state, we give tight bounds in terms of either the cumulative or per-round disturbance magnitude (for \textit{strongly} or \textit{weakly} locally controllable dynamics, respectively). Additionally, we give sublinear regret results for the cases of unknown locally action-linear dynamics as well as for the bandit feedback setting.

        <tr id="Symmetries play a pivotal role in our understanding of the properties of quantum many-body systems. While there are theorems and a well-established toolbox for systems in thermal equilibrium, much less is known about the role of symmetries and their connection to dynamics out of equilibrium. This arises due to the direct link between a system's thermal state and its Hamiltonian, which is generally not the case for nonequilibrium dynamics. Here we present a pathway to identify the effective symmetries and to extract them from data in nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems. Our approach is based on exact relations between correlation functions involving different numbers of spatial points, which can be viewed as nonequilibrium versions of (equal-time) Ward identities encoding the symmetries of the system. We derive symmetry witnesses, which are particularly suitable for the analysis of measured or simulated data at different snapshots in time. To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we apply our method to numerical and experimental data for a spinor Bose gas. We investigate the important question of a dynamical restoration of an explicitly broken symmetry of the Hamiltonian by the initial state. Remarkably, it is found that effective symmetry restoration can occur long before the system equilibrates. We also use the approach to define and identify spontaneous symmetry breaking far from equilibrium, which is of great relevance for applications to nonequilibrium phase transitions. Our work opens new avenues for the classification and analysis of quantum as well as classical many-body dynamics in a large variety of systems, ranging from ultracold quantum gases to cosmology.">

As our main contribution, we significantly accelerate algorithmic approaches for verifying that a neural network is indeed a RASM. The main bottleneck of these approaches is the discretization of the state space of the dynamical system. The following two key contributions allow us to use a coarser discretization than existing approaches. First, we present a novel and fast method to compute tight upper bounds on Lipschitz constants of neural networks based on weighted norms. We further improve these bounds on Lipschitz constants based on the characteristics of the certificate network. Second, we integrate an efficient local refinement scheme that dynamically refines the state space discretization where necessary. Our empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach for verifying neural network policies in several benchmarks and trained with different reinforcement learning algorithms.">

The system features the time derivative of the operator evaluated along the trajectory, which is a Hessian-driven type damping term when the governing operator comes from a potential. Also entering the system is a time rescaling parameter $\beta(t)$ which satisfies a certain growth condition. We derive $o\left(\frac{1}{t^{2r}\beta(t)}\right)$ convergence rates for the norm of the operator evaluated along the generated trajectories as well as for a gap function which serves as a measure of optimality for the associated variational inequality. The parameter $r$ enters the growth condition for $\beta(t)$: when $r<1$, the damping $1/t^{r}$ approaches zero at a slower speed than Nesterov's $1/t$ damping; in this case, we are allowed to choose $\beta(t)$ to be an exponential function, thus having linear convergence rates for the involved quantities. We also show weak convergence of the trajectories towards zeros of the governing operator. Through a particular choice for the operator, we establish a connection with the problem of minimizing a smooth and convex function with linear constraints. The convergence rates we derived in the operator case are inherited by the objective function evaluated at the trajectories and for the feasibility gap. We also prove weak convergence of the trajectories towards primal-dual solutions of the problem. A discretization of the dynamical system yields an implicit algorithm that exhibits analogous convergence properties to its continuous counterpart. We complement our theoretical findings with two numerical experiments.">

        <tr id="Port-Hamiltonian systems (pHS) allow for a structure-preserving modeling of dynamical systems. Coupling pHS via linear relations between input and output defines an overall pHS, which is structure preserving. However, in multiphysics applications, some subsystems do not allow for a physical pHS description, as (a) this is not available or (b) too expensive. Here, data-driven approaches can be used to deliver a pHS for such subsystems, which can then be coupled to the other subsystems in a structure-preserving way. In this work, we derive a data-driven identification approach for port-Hamiltonian differential algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The approach uses input and state space data to estimate nonlinear effort functions of pH-DAEs. As underlying technique, we us (multi-task) Gaussian processes. This work thereby extends over the current state of the art, in which only port-Hamiltonian ordinary differential equation systems could be identified via Gaussian processes. We apply this approach successfully to two applications from network design and constrained multibody system dynamics, based on pH-DAE system of index one and three, respectively.">

However, this feature does not extend to their sampled counterparts, i.e., for a given dynamically feedback linearizable continuous time system, its numerical discretization may fail to be so. In this article, we present a way to construct discretization schemes (accurate up to first order) that result in schemes that are feedback linearizable. This result is an extension of our previous work, where we had considered only static feedback linearizable systems. The result presented here applies to a fairly general class of nonlinear systems, in particular, our analysis applies to both endogenous and exogenous types of feedback. While the results in this article are presented on a control affine form of nonlinear systems, they can be readily modified to general nonlinear systems.">

Previous studies tackled the problem in a non-parametric scenario by simplifying it to finding the maximum y-projection of real solutions (x, y) of a system of the form Sigma = {P=0,  dP/dx=0}, where P is in Z[x, y]. To solve this problem, standard computer algebra methods were employed and analyzed.
In this paper, we extend our approach to address the parametric case. We aim to represent the ````"maximal" y-projection of real solutions of Sigma as a function of the given parameters.To accomplish this, we utilize cylindrical algebraic decomposition. This method allows us to determine the desired value as a function of the parameters within specific regions of parameter space.">

The proposed techniques are shown to be particularly suitable for non-parametric geometries, ultimately enabling the treatment of a diverse range of geometries and topologies. Performance studies are presented in an application context related to the design of aircraft seats and their corresponding mechanical responses to shocks, where the main motivation is to reduce the computational burden and enable the rapid design iteration for such problems that entail non-parametric geometries.

The performance of the algorithm is compared with that of tensor cross-interpolation (TCI) and multiscale interpolative constructions through a comprehensive comparative study.

End-to-end machine learning approaches to inverse problems typically require constructing sophisticated estimators to achieve the desired accuracy, largely because they need to learn the complex underlying physical model. Here, we discuss an alternative paradigm: by making the physical model auto-differentiable we can construct a neural surrogate to represent the unknown physical quantity sought, while avoiding having to relearn the known physics entirely. We dub this process surrogate training embedded in physics (STEP) and illustrate that it generalizes well and is robust against overfitting and significant noise in the data. We demonstrate how STEP can be applied to perform dynamic kernel deconvolution to analyse resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectra and show that surprisingly simple estimator architectures suffice to extract the relevant physical information.">

Orthogonal constraints (Stiefel manifold) is a commonly met constraint in these applications, and the sparsity is usually enforced through the element-wise L1 norm. Many applications can be found on optimization over Stiefel manifold within the area of physics and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel idea by tackling the Stiefel manifold through an nonlinear eigen-approach by first using ADMM to split the problem into smooth optimization over manifold and convex non-smooth optimization, and then transforming the former into the form of nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency (NEPv) which is solved by self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, and the latter can be found to have an closed-form solution through proximal gradient. Compared with existing methods, our proposed algorithm takes the advantage of specific structure of the objective function, and has efficient convergence results under mild assumptions.">

        <tr id="We investigate discrete-time conewise linear systems (CLS) for which all the solutions exhibit a finite number of switches. By switches, we mean transitions of a solution from one cone to another. Our interest in this class of CLS comes from the optimization-based control of an insulin infusion model for which the fact that solutions switch finitely many times appears to be key to establish the global exponential stability of the origin. The stability analysis of this class of CLS greatly simplifies compared to general CLS as all solutions eventually exhibit linear dynamics. The main challenge is to characterize CLS satisfying this finite number of switches property. We first present general conditions in terms of set intersections for this purpose. To ease the testing of these conditions, we translate them as a non-negativity test of linear forms using Farkas lemma. As a result, the problem reduces to verify the non-negativity of a single solution to an auxiliary linear discrete-time system. Interestingly, this property differs from the classical non-negativity problem, where any solution to a system must remain non-negative (component-wise) for any non-negative initial condition, and thus requires novel tools to test it. We finally illustrate the relevance of the presented results on the optimal insulin infusion problem.">

Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges.

In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals.

Further, we examine different established, as well as new ways of combining these models from a system theoretical point of view and highlight two challenges - algebraic loops and local event affect functions in discontinuous models - that require a special approach. Finally, we propose a new wildcard topology, that is capable of describing the generic connection between two combined models in an easy to interpret fashion that can be learned as part of a gradient based optimization procedure.

However, a sufficiently rigorous statement and theoretical proof of this heuristic is lacking in the literature. In this paper, we provide several novel contributions to the literature in this regard. Defining a new notion of nonlocal directional derivative, we analyze its theoretical properties (existence and convergence). Second, using a probabilistic reformulation, we show that nonlocal derivatives are epsilon-sub gradients, and derive sample complexity results for convergence of stochastic gradient descent-like methods using nonlocal derivatives. Finally, using our analysis of the nonlocal gradient of Holder continuous functions, we observe that sample paths of Brownian motion admit nonlocal directional derivatives, and the nonlocal derivatives of Brownian motion are seen to be Gaussian processes with computable mean and standard deviation. Using the theory of nonlocal directional derivatives, we solve a highly nondifferentiable and nonconvex model problem of parameter estimation on image articulation manifolds. Using Brownian motion infused ReLU activation functions with the nonlocal gradient in place of the usual gradient during backpropagation, we also perform experiments on multiple well-studied deep learning architectures. Our experiments indicate the superior generalization capabilities of Brownian neural activation functions in low-training data regimes, where the use of stochastic neurons beats the deterministic ReLU counterpart.">

It allows the study of many systems showing states with large-scale correlations and their classification in a relatively small set of universality classes. RG is the most powerful tool for investigating organizational scales within dynamic systems. However, the application of RG techniques to complex networks has presented significant challenges, primarily due to the intricate interplay of correlations on multiple scales. Existing approaches have relied on hypotheses involving hidden geometries and based on embedding complex networks into hidden metric spaces. Here, we present a practical overview of the recently introduced Laplacian Renormalization Group for heterogeneous networks. First, we present a brief overview that justifies the use of the Laplacian as a natural extension for well-known field theories to analyze spatial disorder. We then draw an analogy to traditional real-space renormalization group procedures, explaining how the LRG generalizes the concept of"Kadanoff supernodes"as block nodes that span multiple scales. These supernodes help mitigate the effects of cross-scale correlations due to small-world properties. Additionally, we rigorously define the LRG procedure in momentum space in the spirit of Wilson RG. Finally, we show different analyses for the evolution of network properties along the LRG flow following structural changes when the network is properly reduced.">

These methodologies have been adapted recently for solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a spectrum of fluid phenomena, from the aerodynamics of vehicles to weather patterns. Within this quantum-inspired paradigm, velocity is encoded as matrix product states (MPS), effectively harnessing the analogy between interscale correlations of fluid dynamics and entanglement in quantum many-body physics. This particular tensor structure is also called quantics tensor train (QTT). By utilizing NVIDIA's cuQuantum library to perform parallel tensor computations on GPUs, our adaptation speeds up simulations by up to 12.1 times. This allows us to study the algorithm in terms of its applicability, scalability, and performance. By simulating two qualitatively different but commonly encountered 2D flow problems at high Reynolds numbers up to $1\times10^7$ using a fourth-order time stepping scheme, we find that the algorithm has a potential advantage over direct numerical simulations in the turbulent regime as the requirements for grid resolution increase drastically. In addition, we derive the scaling $\chi=\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ for the maximum bond dimension $\chi$ of MPS representing turbulent flow fields, with an error $\epsilon$, based on the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy. Our findings motivate further exploration of related quantum algorithms and other tensor network methods.">

        <tr id="Constrained optimization offers a powerful framework to prescribe desired behaviors in neural network models. Typically, constrained problems are solved via their min-max Lagrangian formulations, which exhibit unstable oscillatory dynamics when optimized using gradient descent-ascent. The adoption of constrained optimization techniques in the machine learning community is currently limited by the lack of reliable, general-purpose update schemes for the Lagrange multipliers. This paper proposes the $\nu$PI algorithm and contributes an optimization perspective on Lagrange multiplier updates based on PI controllers, extending the work of Stooke, Achiam and Abbeel (2020). We provide theoretical and empirical insights explaining the inability of momentum methods to address the shortcomings of gradient descent-ascent, and contrast this with the empirical success of our proposed $\nu$PI controller. Moreover, we prove that $\nu$PI generalizes popular momentum methods for single-objective minimization. Our experiments demonstrate that $\nu$PI reliably stabilizes the multiplier dynamics and its hyperparameters enjoy robust and predictable behavior.">

To find a proper state space model, an iterative strategy is presented expanding an initial solution in every step. Harnessing only the measurement data and not their time derivatives a criterion is proposed to select promising extensions to the model avoiding extensive simulation studies on possible model structures.

        <tr id="AI for partial differential equations (PDEs) has garnered significant attention, particularly with the emergence of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The recent advent of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) indicates that there is potential to revisit and enhance the previously MLP-based PINNs. Compared to MLPs, KANs offer interpretability and require fewer parameters. PDEs can be described in various forms, such as strong form, energy form, and inverse form. While mathematically equivalent, these forms are not computationally equivalent, making the exploration of different PDE formulations significant in computational physics. Thus, we propose different PDE forms based on KAN instead of MLP, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Informed Neural Network (KINN). We systematically compare MLP and KAN in various numerical examples of PDEs, including multi-scale, singularity, stress concentration, nonlinear hyperelasticity, heterogeneous, and complex geometry problems. Our results demonstrate that KINN significantly outperforms MLP in terms of accuracy and convergence speed for numerous PDEs in computational solid mechanics, except for the complex geometry problem. This highlights KINN's potential for more efficient and accurate PDE solutions in AI for PDEs.">

        <tr id="Within the context of machine learning-based closure mappings for RANS turbulence modelling, physical realizability is often enforced using ad-hoc postprocessing of the predicted anisotropy tensor. In this study, we address the realizability issue via a new physics-based loss function that penalizes non-realizable results during training, thereby embedding a preference for realizable predictions into the model. Additionally, we propose a new framework for data-driven turbulence modelling which retains the stability and conditioning of optimal eddy viscosity-based approaches while embedding equivariance. Several modifications to the tensor basis neural network to enhance training and testing stability are proposed. We demonstrate the conditioning, stability, and generalization of the new framework and model architecture on three flows: flow over a flat plate, flow over periodic hills, and flow through a square duct. The realizability-informed loss function is demonstrated to significantly increase the number of realizable predictions made by the model when generalizing to a new flow configuration. Altogether, the proposed framework enables the training of stable and equivariant anisotropy mappings, with more physically realizable predictions on new data. We make our code available for use and modification by others.">

        <tr id="Many cognitive models, including those for predicting the time of future events, can be mapped onto a particular form of neural representation in which activity across a population of neurons is restricted to manifolds that specify the Laplace transform of functions of continuous variables. These populations coding Laplace transform are associated with another population that inverts the transform, approximating the original function. This paper presents a neural circuit that uses continuous attractor dynamics to represent the Laplace transform of a delta function evolving in time. One population places an edge at any location along a 1-D array of neurons; another population places a bump at a location corresponding to the edge. Together these two populations can estimate a Laplace transform of delta functions in time along with an approximate inverse transform. Building the circuit so the edge moves at an appropriate speed enables the network to represent events as a function of log time. Choosing the connections appropriately within the edge network make the network states map onto Laplace transform with exponential change as a function of time. In this paper we model a learned temporal association in which one stimulus predicts another at some fixed delay $T$. Shortly after $t=0$ the first stimulus recedes into the past. The Laplace Neural Manifold representing the past maintains the Laplace transform $\exp(-st)$. Another Laplace Neural Manifold represents the predicted future. At $t=0$, the second stimulus is represented a time $T$ in the future. At each moment between 0 and $T$, firing over the Laplace transform predicting the future changes as $\exp[-s(T-t)]$. Despite exponential growth in firing, the circuit is robust to noise, making it a practical means to implement Laplace Neural Manifolds in populations of neurons for a variety of cognitive models.">

We are able to understand the role played by activation functions in separability. Indeed, we show that all non-polynomial activations, such as ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in terms of expressivity, and that they reach maximum discrimination capacity. We demonstrate how assessing the separation power of an equivariant neural network can be simplified to evaluating the separation power of minimal representations. We conclude by illustrating how these minimal components form a hierarchy in separation power.">

        <tr id="We present a novel set of rigorous and computationally efficient topology-based complexity notions that exhibit a strong correlation with the generalization gap in modern deep neural networks (DNNs). DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures correlate highly with generalization error in industry-standards architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures.">

During operation, the emergence of localization is difficult to predict, partly because of changing parameters over the life cycle of a system. This work proposes a novel, network-based approach to predicting an imminent localized vibration. Synthetic measurement data is used to generate a functional network, which captures the dynamic interplay of the machine parts, complementary to their geometric coupling. Analysis of these functional networks reveals an impending localized vibration and its location. The method is demonstrated using a model system for a bladed disk, a ring composed of coupled nonlinear Duffing oscillators. Results indicate that the proposed method is robust against small parameter uncertainties, added measurement noise, and the length of the measurement data samples.

This equation describes the evolution of the distribution of nonlocally interacting particles affected by a common source of noise. The system is directed by a controller that acts on the drift term with the goal of minimising a cost functional. We establish the well-posedness of the state equation, prove the existence of optimal controls, and formulate a stochastic maximum principle (SMP) that provides necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the control problem. The adjoint process arising in the SMP is characterised by a nonlocal (semi)linear backward SPDE for which we study existence and uniqueness. We also rigorously connect the control problem for the nonlinear stochastic Fokker--Planck equation to the control of the corresponding McKean--Vlasov SDE that describes the motion of a representative particle. Our work extends existing results for the control of the Fokker--Planck equation to nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. In particular, the sufficient SMP, which we obtain by exploiting the special structure of the Fokker--Planck equation, seems to be novel even in the linear deterministic setting. We illustrate our results with an application to a model of government interventions in financial systems, supplemented by numerical illustrations.">

        <tr id="Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a"tensor network"(TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.">

        <tr id="We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the 'explicit' dynamics of the object with an 'implicit' flow on free energy gradients - a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.">

In this paper, we present a novel neural network-based approach that discovers self-similarity directly from observed data, without presupposing any models. The presence of self-similar solutions in a physical problem signals that the governing law contains a function whose arguments are given by power-law monomials of physical parameters, which are characterized by power-law exponents. The basic idea is to enforce such particular forms structurally in a neural network in a parametrized way. We train the neural network model using the observed data, and when the training is successful, we can extract the power exponents that characterize scale-transformation symmetries of the physical problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with both synthetic and experimental data, validating its potential as a robust, model-independent tool for exploring self-similarity in complex systems.">

It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.">

        <tr id="The study of population dynamics originated with early sociological works but has since extended into many fields, including biology, epidemiology, evolutionary game theory, and economics. Most studies on population dynamics focus on the problem of prediction rather than control. Existing mathematical models for control in population dynamics are often restricted to specific, noise-free dynamics, while real-world population changes can be complex and adversarial. To address this gap, we propose a new framework based on the paradigm of online control. We first characterize a set of linear dynamical systems that can naturally model evolving populations. We then give an efficient gradient-based controller for these systems, with near-optimal regret bounds with respect to a broad class of linear policies. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for control in population dynamics even for non-linear models such as SIR and replicator dynamics.">

        <tr id="Reservoir computing, a machine learning framework used for modeling the brain, can predict temporal data with little observations and minimal computational resources. However, it is difficult to accurately reproduce the long-term target time series because the reservoir system becomes unstable. This predictive capability is required for a wide variety of time-series processing, including predictions of motor timing and chaotic dynamical systems. This study proposes oscillation-driven reservoir computing (ODRC) with feedback, where oscillatory signals are fed into a reservoir network to stabilize the network activity and induce complex reservoir dynamics. The ODRC can reproduce long-term target time series more accurately than conventional reservoir computing methods in a motor timing and chaotic time-series prediction tasks. Furthermore, it generates a time series similar to the target in the unexperienced period, that is, it can learn the abstract generative rules from limited observations. Given these significant improvements made by the simple and computationally inexpensive implementation, the ODRC would serve as a practical model of various time series data. Moreover, we will discuss biological implications of the ODRC, considering it as a model of neural oscillations and their cerebellar processors.">

We prove the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the learning problem solution and propose a one-shot numerical learning algorithm that—in the leading order—scales linearly in dimension. We show how this technique can be used for the computationally scalable identification of persistent (metastable) regime affiliations and regime switches from high-dimensional non-stationary and noisy time series, i.e., when the size of the data statistics is small compared to their dimensionality and when the noise variance is larger than the variance in the signal. We demonstrate its performance on a set of toy learning problems, comparing eSPA-Markov to state-of-the-art techniques, including deep learning and random forests. We show how this technique can be used for the analysis of noisy time series from DNA and RNA Nanopore sequencing.">

The DEQH model inherently captures the self-consistency nature of Hamiltonian, a critical aspect often overlooked by traditional machine learning approaches for Hamiltonian prediction. By employing DEQ within our model architecture, we circumvent the need for DFT calculations during the training phase to introduce the Hamiltonian's self-consistency, thus addressing computational bottlenecks associated with large or complex systems. We propose a versatile framework that combines DEQ with off-the-shelf machine learning models for predicting Hamiltonians. When benchmarked on the MD17 and QH9 datasets, DEQHNet, an instantiation of the DEQH framework, has demonstrated a significant improvement in prediction accuracy. Beyond a predictor, the DEQH model is a Hamiltonian solver, in the sense that it uses the fixed-point solving capability of the deep equilibrium model to iteratively solve for the Hamiltonian. Ablation studies of DEQHNet further elucidate the network's effectiveness, offering insights into the potential of DEQ-integrated networks for Hamiltonian learning.">

The approach we propose is based on a macro-micro decomposition of the kinetic model in which the angular domain is discretized with a tensor product quadrature rule under the discrete ordinates method. To address the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, the proposed low-rank method is cast in the framework of the hierarchical Tucker decomposition. The adaptive rank integrators we propose are built upon high-order discretizations for both time and space. In particular, this work considers implicit-explicit discretizations for time and finite-difference weighted-essentially non-oscillatory discretizations for space. The high-order singular value decomposition is used to perform low-rank truncation of the high-dimensional time-dependent distribution function. The methods are applied to several benchmark problems, where we compare the solution quality and measure compression achieved by the adaptive rank methods against their corresponding full-grid methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of high-order discretizations in the proposed low-rank framework.">

To decipher their physical laws, we need to bridge between experimental observations and theoretical modeling. Thanks to progress in microscopy and tracking, there is today an abundance of experimental trajectories reflecting these dynamical laws. Inferring physical models from noisy and imperfect experimental data, however, is challenging. Because there are no inference methods that are robust and efficient, model reconstruction from experimental trajectories is a bottleneck to data-driven biophysics. In this Thesis, I present a set of tools developed to bridge this gap and permit robust and universal inference of stochastic dynamical models from experimental trajectories. These methods are rooted in an information-theoretical framework that quantifies how much can be inferred from trajectories that are short, partial and noisy. They permit the efficient inference of dynamical models for overdamped and underdamped Langevin systems, as well as the inference of entropy production rates. I finally present early applications of these techniques, as well as future research directions.">

This approach effectively reduces the computational complexity associated with utilizing second-order information, rendering it applicable in higher-dimensional scenarios. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for non-convex functions, with interpolating rates for arbitrary subspace sizes and allowing inexact curvature estimation. When increasing subspace size, our complexity matches $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ of the cubic regularization (CR) rate. Additionally, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme ensuring exact convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3/2}, \epsilon^{-3})$ to a second-order stationary point, even without sampling all coordinates. Experimental results demonstrate substantial speed-ups achieved by SSCN compared to conventional first-order methods.">

Particularly, we observe a transition from the static asynchronous state to the active phase wave state via the active asynchronous state. We have successfully delineated and quantified the stability boundary of the active asynchronous state through a completely data-driven method. This was achieved by utilizing the enhanced image processing capabilities of convolutional neural networks, specifically, the U-Net architecture. Complementing this data-driven analysis, our study also incorporates an analytical stability of the clustered states, providing a multifaceted perspective on the system's behavior.

Mapping of often incomplete or degraded data to parameters is ill-posed, thus data-driven iterative solutions are required, for example when reconstructing clean images from poor signals. Diffusion models have shown promise as potent generative tools for solving inverse problems due to their superior reconstruction quality and their compatibility with iterative solvers. However, most existing approaches are limited to linear inverse problems represented as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). This simplification falls short of addressing the challenging nature of real-world problems, leading to amplified cumulative errors and biases. We provide an explanation for this gap through the lens of measure-preserving dynamics of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) with which we analyse Temporal Distribution Discrepancy and thus introduce a theoretical framework based on RDS for SDE diffusion models.

Linear statistical methods such as the principal component analysis and its variants are widely used across various fields of applied science to identify and rank these components based on the variance they represent in the data. These methods can be seen as factorizations of the matrix collecting all the data, which are assumed to be a collection of time series sampled from fixed points in space. However, when data sampling locations vary over time, as with mobile monitoring stations in meteorology and oceanography or with particle tracking velocimetry in experimental fluid dynamics, advanced interpolation techniques are required to project the data onto a fixed grid before carrying out the factorization. This interpolation is often expensive and inaccurate. This work proposes a method to decompose scattered data without interpolating. The approach is based on physics-constrained radial basis function regression to compute inner products in space and time. The method provides an analytical and mesh-independent decomposition in space and time, demonstrating higher accuracy than the traditional approach. Our results show that it is possible to distill the most relevant"components"even for measurements whose natural output is a distribution of data scattered in space and time, maintaining high accuracy and mesh independence.">

        <tr id="Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a frequently used optimization technique in classical machine learning and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). For the implementation of VQE on quantum hardware, the results are always affected by measurement shot noise. However, there are many unknowns about the structure and properties of the measurement noise in VQE and how it contributes to the optimization. In this work, we analyze the effect of measurement noise to the optimization dynamics. Especially, we focus on escaping from saddle points in the loss landscape, which is crucial in the minimization of the non-convex loss function. We find that the escape time (1) decreases as the measurement noise increases in a power-law fashion and (2) is expressed as a function of $\eta/N_s$ where $\eta$ is the learning rate and $N_s$ is the number of measurements. The latter means that the escape time is approximately constant when we vary $\eta$ and $N_s$ with the ratio $\eta/N_s$ held fixed. This scaling behavior is well explained by the stochastic differential equation (SDE) that is obtained by the continuous-time approximation of the discrete-time SGD. According to the SDE, $\eta/N_s$ is interpreted as the variance of measurement shot noise. This result tells us that we can learn about the optimization dynamics in VQE from the analysis based on the continuous-time SDE, which is theoretically simpler than the original discrete-time SGD.">

Although Hamiltonian neural networks have been successfully used for modeling dynamics that obey the energy conservation law, they require many data to achieve high performance. The proposed method meta-learns our neural network-based model using datasets in various dynamical systems, such that our model can predict vector fields of unseen systems. In our model, a system representation is inferred from given small data using an encoder network. Then, the system-specific vector field is predicted by modeling the Hamiltonian using a Gaussian process (GP) with neural network-based mean and kernel functions that depend on the inferred system representation. This GP-based Hamiltonian allows us to analytically obtain predictions that are adapted to small data while imposing the constraint of the conservation law. The neural networks are shared across systems, which enables us to learn knowledge from multiple systems, and use it for unseen systems. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods for predicting dynamics from a small number of observations in target systems.">

This paper presents the Fractional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (fKAN), a novel neural network architecture that incorporates the distinctive attributes of KANs with a trainable adaptive fractional-orthogonal Jacobi function as its basis function. By leveraging the unique mathematical properties of fractional Jacobi functions, including simple derivative formulas, non-polynomial behavior, and activity for both positive and negative input values, this approach ensures efficient learning and enhanced accuracy. The proposed architecture is evaluated across a range of tasks in deep learning and physics-informed deep learning. Precision is tested on synthetic regression data, image classification, image denoising, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, the performance is measured on various differential equations, including ordinary, partial, and fractional delay differential equations. The results demonstrate that integrating fractional Jacobi functions into KANs significantly improves training speed and performance across diverse fields and applications.">

        <tr id="Neural networks posses the crucial ability to generate meaningful representations of task-dependent features. Indeed, with appropriate scaling, supervised learning in neural networks can result in strong, task-dependent feature learning. However, the nature of the emergent representations, which we call the `coding scheme', is still unclear. To understand the emergent coding scheme, we investigate fully-connected, wide neural networks learning classification tasks using the Bayesian framework where learning shapes the posterior distribution of the network weights. Consistent with previous findings, our analysis of the feature learning regime (also known as `non-lazy', `rich', or `mean-field' regime) shows that the networks acquire strong, data-dependent features. Surprisingly, the nature of the internal representations depends crucially on the neuronal nonlinearity. In linear networks, an analog coding scheme of the task emerges. Despite the strong representations, the mean predictor is identical to the lazy case. In nonlinear networks, spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to either redundant or sparse coding schemes. Our findings highlight how network properties such as scaling of weights and neuronal nonlinearity can profoundly influence the emergent representations.">

Even for linear models, the effect is not fully understood for arbitrary learning rates and data. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of discrete full batch gradient descent for linear regression. With minimal assumptions, we characterize the trajectory of the parameters and the expected excess risk. Using this characterization, we show that when training with a learning rate schedule $\eta_k$, and a finite time horizon $T$, the early stopped solution $\beta_T$ is equivalent to the minimum norm solution for a generalized ridge regularized problem. We also prove that early stopping is beneficial for generic data with arbitrary spectrum and for a wide variety of learning rate schedules. We provide an estimate for the optimal stopping time and empirically demonstrate the accuracy of our estimate.">

Using this representation, we rigorously establish that the dynamics of mini-batch and full-batch gradient descent agree up to leading order with respect to the step size using the linear scaling rule.

Compared to classical residual-based sampling algorithms, the RMAS algorithm achieves higher system identification accuracy without relying on any hyperparameters. Subsequently, combining the RMAS algorithm and neural network, a few-shot identification (FSI) method for stochastic dynamical systems is proposed, which is applied to the identification of a vegetation biomass change model and the Rayleigh-Van der Pol impact vibration model. We show that the RMAS algorithm modifies residual-based sampling algorithms and, in particular, reduces the system identification error by 76% with the same sample sizes. Moreover, the surrogate model accurately predicts the first escape probability density function and the P bifurcation behavior in the systems, with the error of less than 1.59×10-2. Finally, the robustness of the FSI method is validated.">

However, the real-time application of this approach can be severely limited by the need to solve constrained nonlinear optimization problems at each sampling time. To this end, this work introduces a novel learning-based iterative solver that provides highly accurate predictions, optimality certification, and fast evaluation of the MPC solution at each sampling time. To learn this iterative solver, we propose an unsupervised training algorithm that builds on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, modified by a Fischer-Burmeister formulation, and eliminates the need for prior sampling of exact optimizer solutions. By exploiting efficient vector-Jacobian and Jacobian-vector products via automatic differentiation, the proposed training algorithm can be efficiently executed. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed learning-based iterative solver on the example of nonlinear model predictive control of a nonlinear double integrator. We show its advantages when compared to exact optimizer solutions and with an imitation learning-based approach that directly obtains a data-based approximation of the MPC control law.">

A viable approach to overcome this limitation is to refine the potential by learning from experimental data, which now can be done efficiently using modern automatic differentiation technique. However, potential refinement is mostly performed using thermodynamic properties, leaving the most accessible and informative dynamical data (like spectroscopy) unexploited. In this work, through a comprehensive application of adjoint and gradient truncation methods, we show that both memory and gradient explosion issues can be circumvented in many situations, so the dynamical property differentiation is well-behaved. Consequently, both transport coefficients and spectroscopic data can be used to improve the density functional theory based MLP towards higher accuracy.

        <tr id="Physical learning is an emerging paradigm in science and engineering whereby (meta)materials acquire desired macroscopic behaviors by exposure to examples. So far, it has been applied to static properties such as elastic moduli and self-assembled structures encoded in minima of an energy landscape. Here, we extend this paradigm to dynamic functionalities, such as motion and shape change, that are instead encoded in limit cycles or pathways of a dynamical system. We identify the two ingredients needed to learn time-dependent behaviors irrespective of experimental platforms: (i) learning rules with time delays and (ii) exposure to examples that break time-reversal symmetry during training. After providing a hands-on demonstration of these requirements using programmable LEGO toys, we turn to realistic particle-based simulations where the training rules are not programmed on a computer. Instead, we elucidate how they emerge from physico-chemical processes involving the causal propagation of fields, like in recent experiments on moving oil droplets with chemotactic signalling. Our trainable particles can self-assemble into structures that move or change shape on demand, either by retrieving the dynamic behavior previously seen during training, or by learning on the fly. This rich phenomenology is captured by a modified Hopfield spin model amenable to analytical treatment. The principles illustrated here provide a step towards von Neumann's dream of engineering synthetic living systems that adapt to the environment.">

However, current PINN frameworks are not sufficiently mature for real-world ODE systems, especially those with extreme multi-scale behavior such as mosquito population dynamical modelling. In this research, we propose a PINN framework with several improvements for forward and inverse problems for ODE systems with a case study application in modelling the dynamics of mosquito populations. The framework tackles the gradient imbalance and stiff problems posed by mosquito ordinary differential equations. The method offers a simple but effective way to resolve the time causality issue in PINNs by gradually expanding the training time domain until it covers entire domain of interest. As part of a robust evaluation, we conduct experiments using simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach.

Unlike existing GP-LDS conversion methods, which require separability for most multi-output kernels, our approach works universally for single- and multi-output stationary temporal kernels.

        <tr id="Flow control is key to maximize energy efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, traditional flow-control methods face significant challenges in addressing non-linear systems and high-dimensional data, limiting their application in realistic energy systems. This study advances deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) methods for flow control, particularly focusing on integrating group-invariant networks and positional encoding into DRL architectures. Our methods leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to exploit policy invariance in space, in combination with group-invariant networks to ensure local symmetry invariance. Additionally, a positional encoding inspired by the transformer architecture is incorporated to provide location information to the agents, mitigating action constraints from strict invariance. The proposed methods are verified using a case study of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where the goal is to minimize the Nusselt number Nu. The group-invariant neural networks (GI-NNs) show faster convergence compared to the base MARL, achieving better average policy performance. The GI-NNs not only cut DRL training time in half but also notably enhance learning reproducibility. Positional encoding further enhances these results, effectively reducing the minimum Nu and stabilizing convergence. Interestingly, group invariant networks specialize in improving learning speed and positional encoding specializes in improving learning quality. These results demonstrate that choosing a suitable feature-representation method according to the purpose as well as the characteristics of each control problem is essential. We believe that the results of this study will not only inspire novel DRL methods with invariant and unique representations, but also provide useful insights for industrial applications.">

        <tr id="Energy based models (EBMs) are appealing for their generality and simplicity in data likelihood modeling, but have conventionally been difficult to train due to the unstable and time-consuming implicit MCMC sampling during contrastive divergence training. In this paper, we present a novel energy-based generative framework, Variational Potential Flow (VAPO), that entirely dispenses with implicit MCMC sampling and does not rely on complementary latent models or cooperative training. The VAPO framework aims to learn a potential energy function whose gradient (flow) guides the prior samples, so that their density evolution closely follows an approximate data likelihood homotopy. An energy loss function is then formulated to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between density evolution of the flow-driven prior and the data likelihood homotopy. Images can be generated after training the potential energy, by initializing the samples from Gaussian prior and solving the ODE governing the potential flow on a fixed time interval using generic ODE solvers. Experiment results show that the proposed VAPO framework is capable of generating realistic images on various image datasets. In particular, our proposed framework achieves competitive FID scores for unconditional image generation on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets.">

        <tr id="Numerical ``direct'' approaches to time-optimal control often fail to find solutions that are singular in the sense of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, performing better when searching for saturated (bang-bang) solutions. In previous work by one of the authors, singular solutions were shown to exist for the time-optimal control problem for fully actuated mechanical systems under hard torque constraints. Explicit formulas, based on a Lie theoretic analysis of the problem, were given for singular segments of trajectories, but the global structure of solutions remains unknown. In this work, we review the aforementioned framework, and show how to effectively combine these formulas with the use of general-purpose optimal control software packages. By using the explicit formula given by the theory in the intervals where the numerical solution enters a singular arc, we not only obtain an algebraic expression for the control in that interval but we are also able to remove artifacts present in the numerical solution. In this way, the best features of numerical algorithms and theory complement each other and provide a better picture of the global optimal structure. We illustrate the technique on a two degree of freedom robotic arm example, using two distinct optimal control numerical software packages running on different programming languages.">

        <tr id="Scientific Machine Learning is a new class of approaches that integrate physical knowledge and mechanistic models with data-driven techniques for uncovering governing equations of complex processes. Among the available approaches, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are used to combine prior knowledge in the form of mechanistic formulations with universal function approximators, like neural networks. Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data. The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods. By analysing three synthetic examples of varying complexity, we evaluate the validity and efficiency of ensembles, variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as epistemic UQ methods for UDEs.">

        <tr id="Parameter estimation is one of the central problems in computational modeling of biological systems. Typically, scientists must fully specify the mathematical structure of the model, often expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations, to estimate the parameters. This process poses significant challenges due to the necessity for a detailed understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms. In this paper, we present an approach for estimating model parameters and assessing their identifiability in situations where only partial knowledge of the system structure is available. The partially known model is extended into a system of Hybrid Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, which captures the unknown portions of the system using neural networks. Integrating neural networks into the model structure introduces two primary challenges for parameter estimation: the need to globally explore the search space while employing gradient-based optimization, and the assessment of parameter identifiability, which may be hindered by the expressive nature of neural networks. To overcome the first issue, we treat biological parameters as hyperparameters in the extended model, exploring the parameter search space during hyperparameter tuning. The second issue is then addressed by an a posteriori analysis of parameter identifiability, computed by introducing a variant of a well-established approach for mechanistic models. These two components are integrated into an end-to-end pipeline that is thoroughly described in the paper. We assess the effectiveness of the proposed workflow on test cases derived from three different benchmark models. These test cases have been designed to mimic real-world conditions, including the presence of noise in the training data and various levels of data availability for the system variables. Author summary Parameter estimation is a central challenge in modeling biological systems. Typically, scientists calibrate the parameters by aligning model predictions with measured data once the model structure is defined. Our paper introduces a workflow that leverages the integration between mechanistic modeling and machine learning to estimate model parameters when the model structure is not fully known. We focus mainly on analyzing the identifiability of the model parameters, which measures how confident we can be in the parameter estimates given the available experimental data and partial mechanistic understanding of the system. We assessed the effectiveness of our approach in various in silico scenarios. Our workflow represents a first step to adapting traditional methods used in fully mechanistic models to the scenario of hybrid modeling.">

However, despite their significant success in various fields, it remains unclear in many aspects how to effectively train PINNs if the solutions of PDEs exhibit stiff behaviors or high frequencies. In this paper, we propose a new method for training PINNs using variable-scaling techniques. This method is simple and it can be applied to a wide range of problems including PDEs with rapidly-varying solutions. Throughout various numerical experiments, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for these problems and confirm that it can significantly improve the training efficiency and performance of PINNs. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we will provide theoretical evidence for this phenomenon and show that our methods can indeed improve the performance of PINNs.">

In the first method, we identify a class of systems for which the solution to the continuum (and hence, also an approximate solution to the respective large-scale) kernel equations can be constructed in closed form. In the second method, we provide explicit formulae for the solution to the continuum kernels PDEs, employing a (triple) power series representation of the continuum kernel and establishing its convergence properties. In this case, we also provide means for reducing computational complexity by properly truncating the power series (in the powers of the ensemble variable).

        <tr id="We consider a class of infinite-dimensional singular stochastic control problems. These can be thought of as spatial monotone follower problems and find applications in spatial models of production and climate transition. Let $(D,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a finite measure space and consider the Hilbert space $H:=L^2(D,\mathcal{M},\mu; \mathbb{R})$. Let then $X$ be an $H$-valued stochastic process on a suitable complete probability space, whose evolution is determined through an SPDE driven by a self-adjoint linear operator $\mathcal{A}$ and affected by a cylindrical Brownian motion. The evolution of $X$ is controlled linearly via an $H$-valued control consisting of the direction and the intensity of action, a real-valued nondecreasing right-continuous stochastic process, adapted to the underlying filtration. The goal is to minimize a discounted convex cost-functional over an infinite time-horizon. By combining properties of semiconcave functions and techniques from viscosity theory, we first show that the value function of the problem $V$ is a $C^{1,Lip}(H)$-viscosity solution to the corresponding dynamic programming equation, which here takes the form of a variational inequality with gradient constraint. Then, by allowing the decision maker to choose only the intensity of the control and requiring that the given control direction $\hat{n}$ is an eigenvector of the linear operator $\mathcal{A}$, we establish that the directional derivative $V_{\hat{n}}$ is of class $C^1(H)$, hence a second-order smooth-fit principle in the controlled direction holds for $V$. This result is obtained by exploiting a connection to optimal stopping and combining results and techniques from convex analysis and viscosity theory.">

        <tr id="A persistent challenge in tasks involving large-scale dynamical systems, such as state estimation and error reduction, revolves around processing the collected measurements. Frequently, these data suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to increased computational demands in data processing methodologies. Recent scholarly investigations have underscored the utility of delineating collective states and dynamics via moment-based representations. These representations serve as a form of sufficient statistics for encapsulating collective characteristics, while simultaneously permitting the retrieval of individual data points. In this paper, we reshape the Kalman filter methodology, aiming its application in the moment domain of an ensemble system and developing the basis for moment ensemble noise filtering. The moment system is defined with respect to the normalized Legendre polynomials, and it is shown that its orthogonal basis structure introduces unique benefits for the application of Kalman filter for both i.i.d. and universal Gaussian disturbances. The proposed method thrives from the reduction in problem dimension, which is unbounded within the state-space representation, and can achieve significantly smaller values when converted to the truncated moment-space. Furthermore, the robustness of moment data toward outliers and localized inaccuracies is an additional positive aspect of this approach. The methodology is applied for an ensemble of harmonic oscillators and units following aircraft dynamics, with results showcasing a reduction in both cumulative absolute error and covariance with reduced calculation cost due to the realization of operations within the moment framework conceived.">

The proposed preconditioners can be efficiently diagonalized by fast Fourier transforms in a parallel-in-time fashion, and their effectiveness is theoretically shown in the sense that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix are clustered around $\pm 1$, which leads to rapid convergence when the minimal residual method is used. When the generalized minimal residual method is deployed, the efficacy of the proposed preconditioners are justified in the way that the singular values of the preconditioned matrices are proven clustered around unity.

        <tr id="The advancement of scientific machine learning (ML) techniques has led to the development of methods for approximating solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE) with increased efficiency and accuracy. Automatic differentiation has played a pivotal role in this progress, enabling the creation of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that integrate relevant physics into machine learning models. PINN have shown promise in approximating the solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical discretization methods. However, challenges such as local minima and long training times persist, motivating the exploration of domain decomposition techniques to improve it. Previous domain decomposition models have introduced spatial and temporal domain decompositions but have yet to fully address issues of smoothness and regularity of global solutions. In this study, we present a novel domain decomposition approach for PINN, termed domain-discretized PINN (DD-PINN), which incorporates complementary loss functions, subdomain-specific transformer networks (TRF), and independent optimization within each subdomain. By enforcing continuity and differentiability through interface constraints and leveraging the Sobolev (H 1) norm of the mean squared error (MSE), rather than the Euclidean norm (L 2), DD-PINN enhances solution regularity and accuracy. The inclusion of TRF in each subdomain facilitates feature extraction and improves convergence rates, as demonstrated through simulations of threetest problems: steady-state flow in a two-dimensional lid-driven cavity, the time-dependent cylinder wake, and the viscous Burgers equation. Numerical comparisons highlight the effectiveness of DD-PINN in preserving global solution regularity and accurately approximating complex phenomena, marking a significant advancement over previous domain decomposition methods within the PINN framework.">

While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is a Gaussian Wigner matrix, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or are limited to special cases of noise ensembles. In this paper, using tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals) we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. Remarkably, our analysis unveils the asymptotic equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian one.

Specifically, by resorting to Chebyshev series expansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown parameter matrix and two known structures depending on system state and external disturbance respectively. A Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix by using historical time-series data. Finally, a higher-order disturbance observer (HODO) is developed to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by utilizing the learned portion. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through extensive simulations.

Firstly, using the properties of shift operator and transforming state‐space model with time‐delay into a representation with input and output, then linear dynamic block parameters are learned by the virtue of correlation analysis method in the condition of Gaussian signals. Moreover, a recursive extended least squares estimation is carried out to learn parameters of static nonlinear block and colored noise model under the condition of random signals. The efficiency and accuracy of proposed scheme are confirmed on experiment results of a numerical simulation and a typical practical nonlinear process, and experimental simulation results demonstrate that the learning scheme proposed obtains good learning precision.">

        <tr id="Diffusion models (DMs) are a class of generative machine learning methods that sample a target distribution by transforming samples of a trivial (often Gaussian) distribution using a learned stochastic differential equation. In standard DMs, this is done by learning a ``score function'' that reverses the effect of adding diffusive noise to the distribution of interest. Here we consider the generalisation of DMs to lattice systems with discrete degrees of freedom, and where noise is added via Markov chain jump dynamics. We show how to use tensor networks (TNs) to efficiently define and sample such ``discrete diffusion models'' (DDMs) without explicitly having to solve a stochastic differential equation. We show the following: (i) by parametrising the data and evolution operators as TNs, the denoising dynamics can be represented exactly; (ii) the auto-regressive nature of TNs allows to generate samples efficiently and without bias; (iii) for sampling Boltzmann-like distributions, TNs allow to construct an efficient learning scheme that integrates well with Monte Carlo. We illustrate this approach to study the equilibrium of two models with non-trivial thermodynamics, the $d=1$ constrained Fredkin chain and the $d=2$ Ising model.">

Here, we propose a new computational approach called Automated Dynamical Model Inference based on Expression Trees (ADMIET), in which the machine learning algorithm, the numerical integration of ordinary differential equations and the interpretability from prior knowledge are embedded into the symbolic learning scheme to establish a general framework for revealing the hidden dynamics in time-series data. ADMIET takes full advantage of both machine learning algorithm and expression tree. Firstly, we translate the prior knowledge into constraints on the structure of expression tree, reducing the search space and enhancing the interpretability. Secondly, we utilize the proposed adaptive penalty function to ensure the convergence of gradient descent algorithm and the selection of the symbols. Compared to gene expression programming, ADMIET exhibits its remarkable capability in function fitting with higher accuracy and broader applicability. Moreover, ADMIET can better fit parameters in nonlinear forms compared to regression methods. Furthermore, we apply ADMIET to two typical biological systems and one real data with different prior knowledge to infer the dynamical equations. The results indicate that ADMIET can not only discover the interaction relationships but also provide accurate estimates of the parameters in the equations. These results demonstrate ADMIET's superiority in revealing interpretable dynamics from time-series biological data.">

        <tr id="Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.">

        <tr id="We present a domain decomposition strategy for developing structure-preserving finite element discretizations from data when exact governing equations are unknown. On subdomains, trainable Whitney form elements are used to identify structure-preserving models from data, providing a Dirichlet-to-Neumann map which may be used to globally construct a mortar method. The reduced-order local elements may be trained offline to reproduce high-fidelity Dirichlet data in cases where first principles model derivation is either intractable, unknown, or computationally prohibitive. In such cases, particular care must be taken to preserve structure on both local and mortar levels without knowledge of the governing equations, as well as to ensure well-posedness and stability of the resulting monolithic data-driven system. This strategy provides a flexible means of both scaling to large systems and treating complex geometries, and is particularly attractive for multiscale problems with complex microstructure geometry. While consistency is traditionally obtained in finite element methods via quasi-optimality results and the Bramble-Hilbert lemma as the local element diameter $h\rightarrow0$, our analysis establishes notions of accuracy and stability for finite h with accuracy coming from matching data. Numerical experiments and analysis establish properties for $H(\operatorname{div})$ problems in small data limits ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ reference solutions).">

        <tr id="Generally, discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) creates a sequence of linear systems $A_k x_k = b_k, k = 0, 1, 2, ..., N$ with well-known and structured sparsity patterns. Preconditioners are often necessary to achieve fast convergence When solving these linear systems using iterative solvers. We can use preconditioner updates for closely related systems instead of computing a preconditioner for each system from scratch. One such preconditioner update is the sparse approximate map (SAM), which is based on the sparse approximate inverse preconditioner using a least squares approximation. A SAM then acts as a map from one matrix in the sequence to another nearby one for which we have an effective preconditioner. To efficiently compute an effective SAM update (i.e., one that facilitates fast convergence of the iterative solver), we seek to compute an optimal sparsity pattern. In this paper, we examine several sparsity patterns for computing the SAM update to characterize optimal or near-optimal sparsity patterns for linear systems arising from discretized PDEs.">

        <tr id="Machine learning has been proposed as an alternative to theoretical modeling when dealing with complex problems in biological physics. However, in this perspective, we argue that a more successful approach is a proper combination of these two methodologies. We discuss how ideas coming from physical modeling neuronal processing led to early formulations of computational neural networks, e.g., Hopfield networks. We then show how modern learning approaches like Potts models, Boltzmann machines, and the transformer architecture are related to each other, specifically, through a shared energy representation. We summarize recent efforts to establish these connections and provide examples on how each of these formulations integrating physical modeling and machine learning have been successful in tackling recent problems in biomolecular structure, dynamics, function, evolution, and design. Instances include protein structure prediction; improvement in computational complexity and accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations; better inference of the effects of mutations in proteins leading to improved evolutionary modeling and finally how machine learning is revolutionizing protein engineering and design. Going beyond naturally existing protein sequences, a connection to protein design is discussed where synthetic sequences are able to fold to naturally occurring motifs driven by a model rooted in physical principles. We show that this model is “learnable” and propose its future use in the generation of unique sequences that can fold into a target structure.">

        <tr id="This letter presents a high-dimensional analysis of the training dynamics for a single-layer nonlinear contrastive learning model. The empirical distribution of the model weights converges to a deterministic measure governed by a McKean-Vlasov nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE). Under L2 regularization, this PDE reduces to a closed set of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs), reflecting the evolution of the model performance during the training process. We analyze the fixed point locations and their stability of the ODEs unveiling several interesting findings. First, only the hidden variable's second moment affects feature learnability at the state with uninformative initialization. Second, higher moments influence the probability of feature selection by controlling the attraction region, rather than affecting local stability. Finally, independent noises added in the data argumentation degrade performance but negatively correlated noise can reduces the variance of gradient estimation yielding better performance. Despite of the simplicity of the analyzed model, it exhibits a rich phenomena of training dynamics, paving a way to understand more complex mechanism behind practical large models.">

        <tr id="Our approach is part of the close link between continuous dissipative dynamical systems and optimization algorithms. We aim to solve convex minimization problems by means of stochastic inertial differential equations which are driven by the gradient of the objective function. This will provide a general mathematical framework for analyzing fast optimization algorithms with stochastic gradient input. Our study is a natural extension of our previous work devoted to the first-order in time stochastic steepest descent. Our goal is to develop these results further by considering second-order stochastic differential equations in time, incorporating a viscous time-dependent damping and a Hessian-driven damping. To develop this program, we rely on stochastic Lyapunov analysis. Assuming a square-integrability condition on the diffusion term times a function dependant on the viscous damping, and that the Hessian-driven damping is a positive constant, our first main result shows that almost surely, there is convergence of the values, and states fast convergence of the values in expectation. Besides, in the case where the Hessian-driven damping is zero, we conclude with the fast convergence of the values in expectation and in almost sure sense, we also managed to prove almost sure weak convergence of the trajectory. We provide a comprehensive complexity analysis by establishing several new pointwise and ergodic convergence rates in expectation for the convex and strongly convex case.">

For a wide class of intrinsically ergodic subshifts over a finite alphabet, we show that the space of continuous functions on the shift space splits into two subsets: one is a $G_\delta$ dense set for which all maximizing measures have `relatively small' entropy; the other is contained in the closure of the set of functions having uncountably many, fully supported ergodic measures with `relatively large' entropy. This result considerably generalizes and unifies the results of Morris (2010) and Shinoda (2018), and applies to a wide class of intrinsically ergodic non-Markov symbolic dynamics without Bowen's specification property, including any transitive piecewise monotonic interval map, some coded shifts and multidimensional $\beta$-transformations.

        <tr id="Systems biology tackles the challenge of understanding the high complexity in the internal regulation of homeostasis in the human body through mathematical modelling. These models can aid in the discovery of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets. However, on one hand the development and validation of knowledge-based mechanistic models is time-consuming and does not scale well with increasing features in medical data. On the other hand, more data-driven approaches such as machine learning models require large volumes of data to produce generalizable models. The integration of neural networks and mechanistic models, forming universal differential equation (UDE) models, enables the automated learning of unknown model terms with less data than the neural network alone. Nevertheless, estimating parameters for these hybrid models remains difficult with sparse data and limited sampling durations that are common in biological applications. In this work, we propose the use of physiology-informed regularization, penalizing biologically implausible model behavior to guide the UDE towards more physiologically plausible regions of the solution space. In a simulation study we show that physiology-informed regularization not only results in a more accurate forecasting of model behaviour, but also supports training with less data. We also applied this technique to learn a representation of the rate of glucose appearance in the glucose minimal model using meal response data measured in healthy people. In that case, the inclusion of regularization reduces variability between UDE-embedded neural networks that were trained from different initial parameter guesses. Author summary Systems biology concerns the modelling and analysis of biological processes, by viewing these as interconnected systems. Modelling is typically done either using mechanistic differential equations that are derived from experiments and known biology, or using machine learning on large biological datasets. While mathematical modelling from biological experiments can provide useful insights with limited data, building and validating these models takes a long time and often requires highly invasive measurements in humans. Efforts to combine this classical technique with machine learning have resulted in a framework termed universal differential equations, where the model equations contain a neural network to describe unknown biological interactions. While these methods have shown success in numerous fields, applications in biology are more challenging due to limited data-availability, high data sparsity. In this work, we have introduced physiology-informed regularization to overcome these instabilities and to constrain the model to biologically plausible behavior. Our results show that by using physiology-informed regularization, we can accurately predict future unseen observations in a simulated example, with much more limited data than a similar model without regularization. Additionally, we show an application of this technique on human data, applying a neural network to learn the appearance of glucose in the blood plasma after a meal.">

Newer, coordinate equivariant models promise to provide a coordinate system dependent output in a well defined manner, but recent applications often neglect a direct prediction of directional (i.e. coordinate system dependent) quantities and instead are used to predict still just invariant quantities. This component-wise prediction of tensorial properties is achieved by decomposing tensors into harmonic subspaces via a \textit{tensor spherical harmonic decomposition}, by which we may also associate arbitrary tensors with the irreducible representations of the rotation group. This essentially allows us to read off tensors component-wise from the output representations of these equivariant models. In this work, we present results for the prediction of various material property tensors directly from crystalline structures.

        <tr id="Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has found widespread application in accurate electronic structure calculations. However, it can be computationally demanding especially for large-scale simulations, motivating recent efforts toward its machine-learning (ML) acceleration. We propose a neural network self-consistent fields (NeuralSCF) framework that establishes the Kohn-Sham density map as a deep learning objective, which encodes the mechanics of the Kohn-Sham equations. Modeling this map with an SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer, NeuralSCF emulates the Kohn-Sham self-consistent iterations to obtain electron densities, from which other properties can be derived. NeuralSCF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in electron density prediction and derived properties, featuring exceptional zero-shot generalization to a remarkable range of out-of-distribution systems. NeuralSCF reveals that learning from KS-DFT's intrinsic mechanics significantly enhances the model's accuracy and transferability, offering a promising stepping stone for accelerating electronic structure calculations through mechanics learning.">

        <tr id="Physics-informed deep learning has been developed as a novel paradigm for learning physical dynamics recently. While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.">

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.">

Construction of novel chemical systems with such finely-tuned dynamics is a challenging problem central to the growing field of synthetic biology. In this paper, we address this problem by putting forward a molecular version of a recurrent artificial neural network, which we call a recurrent neural chemical reaction network (RNCRN). We prove that the RNCRN, with sufficiently many auxiliary chemical species and suitable fast reactions, can be systematically trained to achieve any dynamics. This approximation ability is shown to hold independent of the initial conditions for the auxiliary species, making the RNCRN more experimentally feasible. To demonstrate the results, we present a number of relatively simple RNCRNs trained to display a variety of biologically-important dynamical features.">

However, not all scientific applications conform to this pattern, i.e. plane wave Density Functional Theory codes require multi-dimensional Fourier transforms applied on data represented as batches of spheres.

By taking advantage of the orthogonality of the original basis, our procedure circumvents the well-known instability problem arising from the matrix inversion involved in classical polynomial regression. Moreover, the recurrent generation of biorthogonal polynomials in our framework facilitates the upgrading of all polynomials to include one additional element in the set whilst also allowing for a natural downgrading of the polynomial regression approximation. This is achieved by the posterior removal of any basis element leading to a straightforward approach for reducing the approximation order. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through a series of examples where we derive the resulting biorthogonal polynomials from Legendre, Laguerre, and Chebyshev orthogonal bases.">

This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined on manifold surfaces embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.">

We prove quantitative convergence of the hierarchy as the degree increases and use it to solve unconstrained and constrained polynomial optimization problems parameterized by random variables. By employing $n$-body priors from condensed matter physics to induce sparsity, we can use S-SOS to produce solutions and uncertainty intervals for sensor network localization problems containing up to 40 variables and semidefinite matrix sizes surpassing $800 \times 800$.">

        <tr id="Subspace clustering (SC) algorithms utilize the union of subspaces model to cluster data points according to the subspaces from which they are drawn. To better address separability of subspaces and robustness to noise we propose a wavelet packet (WP) based transform domain subspace clustering. Depending on the number of resolution levels, WP yields several representations instantiated in terms of subbands. The first approach combines original and subband data into one complementary multi-view representation. Afterward, we formulate joint representation learning as a low-rank MERA tensor network approximation problem. That is motivated by the strong representation power of the MERA network to capture complex intra/inter-view dependencies in corresponding self-representation tensor. In the second approach, we use a self-stopping computationally efficient method to select the subband with the smallest clustering error on the validation set. When existing SC algorithms are applied to the chosen subband, their performance is expected to improve. Consequently, both approaches enable the re-use of SC algorithms developed so far. Improved clustering performance is due to the dual nature of subbands as representations and filters, which is essential for noise suppression. We exemplify the proposed WP domain approach to SC on the MERA tensor network and eight other well-known linear SC algorithms using six well-known image datasets representing faces, digits, and objects. Although WP domain-based SC is a linear method, it achieved clustering performance comparable with some best deep SC algorithms and outperformed many other deep SC algorithms by a significant margin. That is in particular case for the WP MERA SC algorithm. On the COIL100 dataset, it achieves an accuracy of 87.45% and outperforms the best deep SC competitor in the amount of 14.75%.">

The proposed decomposition method can be applied to fractional-order PWL systems composed of nth PWL functions, where each PWL function may have any number of affine segments.

By combining concepts from the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) and Theory-Guided Neural Network (TgNN) models, SCTgNN aims to enhance our understanding of complex phenomena, particularly within nonlinear systems that defy conventional patterns. To begin, we employ the TgNN method to predict the behaviours of localized waves, including solitons, rogue waves, and breathers, within the generalized NLS equation.

        <tr id="Neural networks are lately more and more often being used in the context of data-driven control, as an approximate model of the true system dynamics. Model Predictive Control (MPC) adopts this practise leading to neural MPC strategies. This raises a question of whether the trained neural network has converged and generalized in a way that the learned model encapsulates an accurate approximation of the true dynamic model of the system, thus making it a reliable choice for model-based control, especially for disturbed and uncertain systems. To tackle that, we propose Dropout MPC, a novel sampling-based ensemble neural MPC algorithm that employs the Monte-Carlo dropout technique on the learned system model. The closed loop is based on an ensemble of predictive controllers, that are used simultaneously at each time-step for trajectory optimization. Each member of the ensemble influences the control input, based on a weighted voting scheme, thus by employing different realizations of the learned system dynamics, neural control becomes more reliable by design. An additional strength of the method is that it offers by design a way to estimate future uncertainty, leading to cautious control. While the method aims in general at uncertain systems with complex dynamics, where models derived from first principles are hard to infer, to showcase the application we utilize data gathered in the laboratory from a real mobile manipulator and employ the proposed algorithm for the navigation of the robot in simulation.">

        <tr id="This paper addresses the need for deep learning models to integrate well-defined constraints into their outputs, driven by their application in surrogate models, learning with limited data and partial information, and scenarios requiring flexible model behavior to incorporate non-data sample information. We introduce Bayesian Entropy Neural Networks (BENN), a framework grounded in Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principles, designed to impose constraints on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) predictions. BENN is capable of constraining not only the predicted values but also their derivatives and variances, ensuring a more robust and reliable model output. To achieve simultaneous uncertainty quantification and constraint satisfaction, we employ the method of multipliers approach. This allows for the concurrent estimation of neural network parameters and the Lagrangian multipliers associated with the constraints. Our experiments, spanning diverse applications such as beam deflection modeling and microstructure generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of BENN. The results highlight significant improvements over traditional BNNs and showcase competitive performance relative to contemporary constrained deep learning methods.">

        <tr id="In this paper, we provide a multiscale perspective on the problem of maximum marginal likelihood estimation. We consider and analyse a diffusion-based maximum marginal likelihood estimation scheme using ideas from multiscale dynamics. Our perspective is based on stochastic averaging; we make an explicit connection between ideas in applied probability and parameter inference in computational statistics. In particular, we consider a general class of coupled Langevin diffusions for joint inference of latent variables and parameters in statistical models, where the latent variables are sampled from a fast Langevin process (which acts as a sampler), and the parameters are updated using a slow Langevin process (which acts as an optimiser). We show that the resulting system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be viewed as a two-time scale system. To demonstrate the utility of such a perspective, we show that the averaged parameter dynamics obtained in the limit of scale separation can be used to estimate the optimal parameter, within the strongly convex setting. We do this by using recent uniform-in-time non-asymptotic averaging bounds. Finally, we conclude by showing that the slow-fast algorithm we consider here, termed Slow-Fast Langevin Algorithm, performs on par with state-of-the-art methods on a variety of examples. We believe that the stochastic averaging approach we provide in this paper enables us to look at these algorithms from a fresh angle, as well as unlocking the path to develop and analyse new methods using well-established averaging principles.">

This capability is essential for ensuring the safe operation of bridges and preventing sudden catastrophic failures. However, FEM computational cost and the need for realtime analysis pose significant challenges. Additionally, the input data is a 7 dimensional vector, while the output is a 1017 dimensional vector, making accurate and efficient analysis particularly difficult. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid quantum classical Multilayer Perceptron pipeline leveraging Symmetric Positive Definite matrices and Riemannian manifolds for effective data representation. To maintain the integrity of the qubit structure, we utilize SPD matrices, ensuring data representation is well aligned with the quantum computational framework. Additionally, the method leverages polynomial feature expansion to capture nonlinear relationships within the data. The proposed pipeline combines classical fully connected neural network layers with quantum circuit layers to enhance model performance and efficiency. Our experiments focused on various configurations of such hybrid models to identify the optimal structure for accurate and efficient realtime analysis. The best performing model achieved a Mean Squared Error of 0.00031, significantly outperforming traditional methods.">

Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open methods.">

        <tr id="Many problems in Physics and Chemistry are formulated as the minimization of a functional. Therefore, methods for solving these problems typically require differentiating maps whose input and/or output are functions -- commonly referred to as variational differentiation. Such maps are not addressed at the mathematical level by the chain rule, which underlies modern symbolic and algorithmic differentiation (AD) systems. Although there are algorithmic solutions such as tracing and reverse accumulation, they do not provide human readability and introduce strict programming constraints that bottleneck performance, especially in high-performance computing (HPC) environments. In this manuscript, we propose a new computer theoretic model of differentiation by combining the pullback of the $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{C}$ combinators from the combinatory logic. Unlike frameworks based on the chain rule, this model differentiates a minimal complete basis for the space of computable functions. Consequently, the model is capable of analytic backpropagation and variational differentiation while supporting complex numbers. To demonstrate the generality of this approach we build a system named CombDiff, which can differentiate nontrivial variational problems such as Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and multilayer perceptrons.">

Recently, local structural variables identified using machine learning, such as"softness", have emerged as predictors of local dynamics. Here we construct a model using softness to describe the structural origins of dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquids. In our model, the probability of particles to rearrange is determined by their softness, and each rearrangement induces changes in the softness of nearby particles, describing facilitation. We show how to ensure that these changes respect the underlying time-reversal symmetry of the liquid's dynamics. The model reproduces the salient features of dynamical heterogeneity, and demonstrates how long-ranged dynamical correlations can emerge at long time scales from a relatively short softness correlation length.">

Finally, we learn this function in the sense of sparse approximation in a suitable function space by detecting coefficients of the basis expansion with largest absolute value. Investigating the corresponding indices of the basis coefficients yields further insights on the structure of the solution as well as its dependency on the parameters and their interactions and allows for a reasonable generalization to even higher dimensions and therefore better resolutions of the deconstructed source function.">

 Hamilton energy, which reflects the energy variation of systems, is one of the crucial instruments used to analyze the characteristics of dynamical systems. Here we propose a method to deduce Hamilton energy based on the existing systems. This derivation process consists of three steps: Step 1, decomposing the vector field; Step 2, solving the Hamilton energy function; and Step 3, verifying uniqueness. In order to easily choose an appropriate decomposition method, we propose a classification criterion based on the form of system state variables, i.e., type I vector fields that can be directly decomposed and type II vector fields decomposed via exterior differentiation. Besides, exterior differentiation is used to represent the curl of low-high dimension vector fields in the process of decomposition. Finally, we exemplify the Hamilton energy function of six classical systems and analyze the relationship between Hamilton energy and dynamic behavior. This solution provides a new approach for deducing the Hamilton energy function, especially in high-dimensional systems.">

        <tr id="Markov jump processes are continuous-time stochastic processes which describe dynamical systems evolving in discrete state spaces. These processes find wide application in the natural sciences and machine learning, but their inference is known to be far from trivial. In this work we introduce a methodology for zero-shot inference of Markov jump processes (MJPs), on bounded state spaces, from noisy and sparse observations, which consists of two components. First, a broad probability distribution over families of MJPs, as well as over possible observation times and noise mechanisms, with which we simulate a synthetic dataset of hidden MJPs and their noisy observation process. Second, a neural network model that processes subsets of the simulated observations, and that is trained to output the initial condition and rate matrix of the target MJP in a supervised way. We empirically demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) model can infer, in a zero-shot fashion, hidden MJPs evolving in state spaces of different dimensionalities. Specifically, we infer MJPs which describe (i) discrete flashing ratchet systems, which are a type of Brownian motors, and the conformational dynamics in (ii) molecular simulations, (iii) experimental ion channel data and (iv) simple protein folding models. What is more, we show that our model performs on par with state-of-the-art models which are finetuned to the target datasets.">

We focus on a class of equations that are linear in their parameters (with unknown coefficients $\theta_\star$). We show that when the partial differential equation admits a classical solution (say $u_\star$), differentiable to order $\beta$, the mean square error of the Bayesian posterior mean is at least of order $n^{-2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$. Furthermore, we establish a convergence rate of the linear coefficients of $\theta_\star$ depending on the order of the underlying differential operator.

In these models, one potential goal is to determine if noise can induce transitions between states, and if so, to calculate the most probable escape path from an attractor. In the small noise limit, the Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations provides a variational framework to calculate these paths. This work focuses on using large deviation theory to calculate such paths for stochastic gradient systems with non-gradient perturbations. While for gradient systems the most probable escape paths consist of time-reversed heteroclinic orbits, for general systems it can be a challenging calculation. By applying Melnikov theory to the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations recast in Hamiltonian form, we determine a condition for when the optimal escape path is the heteroclinic orbit for the perturbed system. We provide a numerical example to illustrate how the computed most probable escape path compares with the theoretical result.">

DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish movement control in a fluid environment. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.">

We aim to show that the complicated non-linear dynamics of an ocean circulation can be captured by a flexible, efficient, and expressive structure of the FNO networks. The machine learning model (FNO3D and the recurrent FNO2D networks) trained by simulated data as well as real data takes spatiotemporal input and predicts future ocean states (sea surface current and sea surface height). For this, the double gyre ocean circulation model driven by stochastic wind stress is considered to represent an ideal ocean circulation. In order to generate the training and test data that exhibits rich spatiotemporal variability, the initial states are perturbed by Gaussian random fields. Experimental results confirm that the trained models yield satisfactory prediction accuracy for both types of FNO models in this case. Second, as the training set, we used the HYCOM reanalysis data in a regional ocean. FNO2D experiments demonstrated that the 5-day input to 5-day prediction yields the averaged root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 5.0 cm/s, 6.7 cm/s, 7.9 cm/s, 8.9 cm/s, and 9.4 cm/s in surface current, calculated consecutively for each day, in a regional ocean circulation of the East/Japan Sea. Similarly, the RMSEs for sea surface height were 2.3 cm, 3.5 cm, 4.2 cm, 4.6 cm, and 4.9 cm, for each day. We also trained the model with 15-day input and 10-day prediction, resulting in comparable performance. Extensive numerical tests show that, once learned, the resolution-free FNO model instantly forecasts the ocean states and can be used as an alternative fast solver in various inference algorithms.">
